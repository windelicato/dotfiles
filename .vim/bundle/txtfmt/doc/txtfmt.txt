2. Motivation						*txtfmt-motivation*

In addition to using Vim to edit C code, I sometimes use it to write notes of
various kinds. Sometimes these notes are temporary in nature, and sometimes
they are meant to be more permanent; for example, a document describing
various subsystems in a large programming project. For a task of this nature,
Vim offers many advantages over a typical word processor. Features like word
completion, multiple text registers, tags, cscope, etc.  are very useful when
documenting source code. However, there was always one advantage that a word
processor had when it came to creating non source code documents: formatted
text. The ability to set certain regions of text to an arbitrary foreground or
background color, or to make them stand out with attributes such as bold,
italic and underline can make a document much more readable, and hence, more
useful.

I realize that there are a number of very powerful formatting languages and
utilities, which may be used to create such documents. What I wanted, however,
was something very lightweight, something that depended only upon Vim. In
other words, I didn't want to create a file, which could be operated upon by a
tool, to create a file for viewing. I wanted only 1 file, the one I edited
with Vim, which could be viewed "on-the-fly," as each editing change was made.
The Txtfmt plugin is my solution for creating formatted documents with Vim,
to be viewed within Vim.

==============================================================================
3. Overview						*txtfmt-overview*

Txtfmt's formatting is accomplished through the use of single-character
"tokens" (chosen from ranges not normally used in text files), which are used
to define highlight attributes for subsequent text. The tokens themselves are
concealed by Txtfmt's syntax file, so that each appears as a single space (or
not at all if your version of Vim was compiled with "conceal" support - see
|txtfmt-'conceal'|)
Note: See section |txtfmt-cterm-ignore-issue| if you notice that tokens are
not hidden on your system.

Txtfmt requires 9 of the aforementioned tokens for foreground color regions,
and an additional 9 tokens if background colors are enabled (see
txtfmt-'tokrange' ). The |txtfmt-'tokrange'| option setting also determines
the number of tokens required for format regions. If the tokrange suffix is
'S' (short formats) or 'X' (extended), then the only formatting attributes in
use are bold, underline and italic. All possible permutations of these
attributes may be represented with only 8 tokens. If, on the other hand, the
tokrange suffix is 'L' (long formats), the set of available format attributes
expands to include standout, reverse and (for Vim versions >= 7.0) undercurl.
In this case, Txtfmt will require either 32 or 64 format tokens, depending
upon whether the version of Vim supports undercurl.

There are 3 types of Txtfmt marker token: format, foreground color and
background color. The 3 types of regions begun by these 3 types of tokens are
"orthogonal"; i.e., the presence of one has no effect upon any others that
happen to be active at that point in the buffer. For example, suppose you have
begun a green color region by inserting the appropriate token (with one of
Txtfmt's mappings, to be discussed later). You now wish to emphasize a word or
phrase by formatting it in italics, but you do not wish to change the color.
In this case, you would simply insert the format token denoting "italic", and
subsequently typed text would be green italic. If you later wished to switch
back to un-italicized (normal) green text, you would simply insert the format
token corresponding to "no format". Note that format and color tokens may be
freely interspersed with one another in any order.

The tokens described above are simply characters belonging to the character
set in use (e.g. latin1, utf-8, etc...), so it would be theoretically possible
to accomplish the highlighting with a syntax file alone, by simply inserting
the marker characters with CTRL-V or something similar. However, this would
require you to memorize the character codes corresponding to 8 colors and all
combinations of underline, bold, italic, etc... Thus, in addition to a syntax
file, Txtfmt provides a filetype plugin (ftplugin), which provides mappings
and functions to facilitate working with the format/color tokens. Inserting
tokens, finding (jumping to) tokens, and querying token type, are a few of the
operations that can be performed with mappings and/or functions defined in the
ftplugin.

==============================================================================
4. Installation					*txtfmt-installation*

DISTRIBUTED FILES				*txtfmt-dist-files*

The Txtfmt distribution comprises the following 4 files:

doc/txtfmt.txt		Txtfmt help file (this file)
ftplugin/txtfmt.vim	Txtfmt filetype plugin (contains mappings for working
			with Txtfmt tokens)
syntax/txtfmt.vim	Txtfmt syntax file (defines the Txtfmt syntax
			highlighting)
plugin/txtfmt.vim	Txtfmt common configuration code (contains
			configuration script needed by both the filetype and
			syntax plugins)
indent_patch.txt	Bram Moolenaar's patch to fix indent.vim's handling of
			dot-separated lists in 'filetype' option values
			(required only if your version of Vim is older than
			7.2 and you plan to "nest" Txtfmt within other
			filetypes)
			For details, see |txtfmt-combining|.

All of the txtfmt.vim files should be placed in their respective parent
directories, somewhere in your 'runtimepath'. If you need the patch files, you
may place them wherever you like.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To make Txtfmt help topics visible to Vim's :help command, you
must run :helptags, passing the path to the doc folder where you unpacked
txtfmt.txt as an argument.

DETECTING OR SETTING TXTFMT FILETYPE		*txtfmt-filetype*

Once you have copied the Txtfmt files to the appropriate directories in
'runtimepath', you can always use the Txtfmt syntax and mappings by manually
setting the 'filetype' option. (I am assuming, of course, that you have
enabled syntax at some point, most likely in your .vimrc. If you are not sure
about this, see |syntax-enable|.) The 'filetype' option may be set on the
command line: e.g. >
    :set ft=txtfmt

A better approach for a file designed to be viewed with Txtfmt highlighting
would be to set the filetype in a Vim modeline: e.g. >
    vim:ft=txtfmt

While the manual approach may be appropriate for some uses, if you find
yourself always using Txtfmt with certain types of files, it probably makes
sense to set up automatic detection via one of the methods discussed in the
section |new-filetype| in the Vim help. The simplest approach is to create
your own filetype.vim (assuming you haven't done so already) in a directory
that comes before $VIMRUNTIME in 'runtimepath'. Within this script, you should
define an autocommand that will :setfiletype to txtfmt for any file with an
appropriate extension.

Example: >
    " Set up detection for Txtfmt files
    au! filetypedetect BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt    setfiletype txtfmt

COMBINING TXTFMT WITH OTHER FILETYPES		*txtfmt-combining*

It is possible to use the Txtfmt plugins with the plugins of other filetypes.
This feature is useful when you wish to take advantage of Txtfmt's arbitrary
formatting capabilities in a file that would otherwise support only static
formatting. The simplest way to accomplish this is to set 'filetype' to a
dot-separated list of filetype names: e.g. "c.txtfmt". When you do this, Vim
will load the corresponding filetype and syntax files in the order in which
they appear in the list.

WARNING: Txtfmt's filetype plugin is designed to be used in this way; some of
the standard plugins, however, will skip loading if a plugin that sets
b:did_ftplugin has already been sourced. Thus, it is best to put Txtfmt last
in the list of filetypes.

The method just described is useful when you wish to use Txtfmt in conjunction
with an existing filetype. It is possible, however, that you simply wish to
extend Txtfmt by adding a few predefined formatting regions. As an example,
suppose you find yourself highlighting things like "TODO" and "IMPORTANT NOTE"
quite often in your Txtfmt files. You can always highlight them manually by
using Txtfmt markers; it would be more efficient, however, to define syntax
highlighting that handles these special cases automatically. You could do this
in a special Txtfmt syntax file, which you create in an "after" directory in
your 'runtimepath'. (See |after-directory|.)

Nesting Txtfmt regions				*txtfmt-nesting*

Whether you are combining Txtfmt with an existing filetype, or simply
extending Txtfmt's highlighting with predefined regions of your own, it is
possible that you will want to use Txtfmt's highlighting within non-txtfmt
syntax regions. If, for example, you are using Txtfmt in combination with C
syntax, you may wish to create Txtfmt regions within C comments. This is
possible, but only if you have set the |txtfmt-'nested'| option. If you are
nesting Txtfmt regions within non-Txtfmt regions, you should generally
terminate the Txtfmt regions explicitly, rather than relying upon the
containing region to terminate it. A containing region without a "keepend"
argument will not be able to terminate the Txtfmt region. A containing region
with "keepend" will terminate the Txtfmt region, but the containing region's
end marker may not be formatted correctly unless a "matchgroup" was used to
define it.

A few practical examples follow...

C source file nesting example:			*txtfmt-nesting-c-example*

Here is how you could use Txtfmt to format your C-language comments...

Put the following within your user "filetype.vim"
(e.g. $VIM/vimfiles/filetype.vim) >
    " Allow Txtfmt regions to be nested within C comments
    augroup filetypedetect
	au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.c    let b:txtfmtNested = 1
	au  BufRead,BufNewFile *.c    setf c.txtfmt
    augroup END

Now, you may use Txtfmt mappings to add color and formatting regions to your C
comments! (Technically, of course, you can format anything in the file, but
I'm assuming you want the source file to compile.)

						*indent_patch.txt*
IMPORTANT NOTE: Prior to Vim 7.2, the distributed version of "indent.vim" was
not aware of the dot-separated filetype name convention. Thus, if you're using
an older version of Vim, C-indenting will not work properly if you set
filetype to "c.txtfmt". Bram's patch for this issue is packaged along with the
Txtfmt files. If you have not yet upgraded to the latest version of Vim, and
you do not wish to apply the patch, you could work around the issue with an
alternative approach such as this: >
    " Allow Txtfmt regions to be nested within C comments without losing
    " cindent capability in pre-7.2 Vim.
    augroup filetypedetect
	" Set filetype to c
	au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.c    setf c
	" Make sure Txtfmt regions can nest within comments
	au  BufRead,BufNewFile *.c    let b:txtfmtNested = 1
	" Manually source the Txtfmt filetype and syntax plugin files...
	au  BufRead,BufNewFile *.c    runtime syntax/txtfmt.vim
	au  BufRead,BufNewFile *.c    runtime ftplugin/txtfmt.vim
    augroup END

Of course, it's probably easier just to upgrade Vim;-)

TVO nesting example:				*txtfmt-nesting-tvo-example*

Here is how you could use Txtfmt to format the ordinary text within .otl files
created with TVO (The Vim Outliner plugin written by Ned Konz)...

Put the following within the ftdetect/otl.vim file distributed with the TVO
plugin: >
	" This sets up *.otl files to be outlined
	au  BufRead,BufNewFile *.otl    setf otl.txtfmt

Important Note: Because the TVO plugin was not designed to work with the
"dot-separated" filetype syntax, it is important that your .otl files DO NOT
set 'filetype' within a Vim modeline; i.e., the set of 'filetype' to
otl.txtfmt should occur exclusively within the autocommand as shown above.

'Notes' nesting example:			*txtfmt-nesting-notes-example*

Here is how you could use Txtfmt to format the ordinary text within files
created with 'Notes' (the lightweight notes management plugin written by Hari
Krishna Dara)...

In your .vimrc, set the g:notesFileType option as follows: >
	let g:notesFileType = 'txtfmt'

This instructs the 'Notes' plugin to set 'filetype' to txtfmt for all notes
files it creates.

LOADING						*txtfmt-loading*

Note: This section is provided for informational purposes only; the average
user can safely skip.

The Txtfmt plugin is actually several plugins working in concert: a syntax
plugin implementing token based highlighting, and a filetype plugin
facilitating working with the tokens. There are a significant number of
options permitting customization of various aspects of both plugins. Due to
the tightly integrated nature of the syntax and filetype plugins, most of the
options used to customize Txtfmt's behavior have implications for both
filetype and syntax plugins. Problems can result when the filetype and syntax
plugins see different values for the shared options. Since most Txtfmt options
are used only when the plugin is sourced, option values can get out of sync if
the filetype and syntax plugins are sourced at different times with
intervening option changes. The best protection against this is to have the
plugins loaded in the standard manner, via :setfiletype or assignment to
'filetype' option, as previously described.

Just as many of the options are common to both filetype and syntax plugins, so
is much of the option processing and attendant configuration code. It would be
highly inefficient (and dangerous from a maintainability standpoint) to
maintain large blocks of identical Vim script in two different script files.
Accordingly, I have segregated the option/configuration processing, which is
common to both filetype and syntax, and located it in a separate file, which
is intended to be installed in the user's plugin directory:
($VIM/plugin/txtfmt.vim). Very little of the script in this file is actually
executed at Vim startup. Most of it is executed only upon demand by either the
filetype or syntax plugin (whichever happens to be sourced first when Txtfmt
is loaded). When the common configuration script is executed, it processes the
various options (|txtfmt-modeline|, buffer-local and global), and saves the
resulting configuration to buffer-local variables, where it may be accessed by
both the filetype and syntax plugins.

Although the details will vary according to the user's setup, it generally
works something like this...

-FileType set to txtfmt
--Txtfmt syntax file is sourced
---Txtfmt syntax file invokes common configuration code in
   $VIM/plugin/txtfmt.vim
--Txtfmt filetype plugin is sourced

==============================================================================
5. Configuration				*txtfmt-configuration*

OPTIONS						*txtfmt-options*

There are 3 ways for the Txtfmt user to set most Txtfmt options. The 3 methods
are listed below in order of highest to lowest priority.

    1. in a Txtfmt modeline
    2. with a buffer-local option variable
    3. with a global option variable

Note: Some options do not support all 3 mechanisms. The help for a specific
option indicates which mechanisms may be used to set it.

Txtfmt will attempt to determine the value of an option from the highest
priority mechanism employed by the user.
Note: If the option value obtained in this manner is invalid, Txtfmt will not
consider lower-priority mechanisms. (In other words, the decision about which
user setting to use is made before the option value is validated.)

Although different strategies may be conceived by the Txtfmt user, the
intended use of the 3 mechanisms is as follows:

Txtfmt modelines
	Used to associate options with a particular file
buffer-local
	Used to set options automatically for a particular buffer or filetype.
	Hint: Set buffer-local options in your local filetype.vim just before
	calling :setfiletype
global
	Used to set defaults for options not overridden by one of the
	preceding 2 methods

Buffer-local and global option variables are set just like any other such
variables in Vim.

Examples: >
	:let b:txtfmtEscape = 'bslash'
	:let g:txtfmtNested = 1

For details on setting options via Txtfmt modelines, see |txtfmt-modeline|.

Option naming convention			*txtfmt-opt-names*

Since the buffer-local and global Txtfmt options share a namespace with other
Vim global variables, the "txtfmt" prefix is prepended to these option names.
The option name itself is capitalized. Since a |txtfmt-modeline| is processed
only by Txtfmt, the "txtfmt" prefix is omitted from a |txtfmt-modeline| option
name. The modeline form of the option name is all lowercase, and just as with
Vim options, a short form of the option name is provided. In the option list
below, both the buflocal/global and modeline forms of each option are shown.


Option types					*txtfmt-opt-types*

Txtfmt options fall into one of three categories:

1. String options
2. Number options
3. Boolean options

In most cases, the rhs of the assignment used to set the option's value is
identical for all set mechanisms (txtfmt modelines, buffer-local and global),
except of course that string options are not quoted in a Txtfmt modeline.
Boolean options are a special case, however. Setting and clearing boolean
options in a Txtfmt modeline is accomplished in the same manner as it is for a
Vim modeline: by including the bare option name in the modeline to turn the
option on, or by prepending "no" to the bare option name to turn it off.

Examples: >
	" Txtfmt modeline that turns nesting ON
	txtfmt:nested
	" Txtfmt modeline that turns nesting OFF
	txtfmt:nonested

Number format					*txtfmt-opt-num-fmt*

Unless otherwise specified, a Txtfmt numeric option (represented with {number}
in this document) may be specified in either decimal or hexadecimal format:
e.g.
    0, 1000, 0x8f, 0x1F1F
are all valid values for numeric options.

Txtfmt modelines					*txtfmt-modeline*

Since a Txtfmt file should generally be viewed with the same set of options
that were in effect when it was created, Txtfmt provides a way to associate
certain option values with the file itself. Vim users should be familiar with
the concept of a modeline. Txtfmt extends this concept to a "Txtfmt-modeline",
which may be used to set various Txtfmt-specific options, described later. As
a general rule, an option that may be set from a Txtfmt-modeline may also be
set buffer-locally and/or globally, using the corresponding buffer-local or
global option variable.
Note: Txtfmt will search the first and last |txtfmtModelines| lines of a file
looking for a Txtfmt-modeline. All valid Txtfmt-modelines found will be used;
however, the search for valid modelines stops as soon as an invalid modeline
is encountered. (This is consistent with Vim's modeline processing.)

Format of a Txtfmt-modeline			*txtfmt-modeline-fmt*
	Txtfmt modelines are based upon the 1st Vim modeline format
	       [text]{white}txtfmt:[white]{options}

	where {options} is a comma or whitespace separated list of Txtfmt
	option settings. For a description of the various {options}, see
	|txtfmt-opt-list|.

	Note: Since Vim will not choke on a trailing ':' (probably because a
	trailing ':' may be viewed as introducing an empty option field),
	neither will I.

	Examples: >
		txtfmt:tokrange=180X:escape=bslash
		txtfmt:rng=0xE000L esc=self nested

Refreshing display after option changes		*txtfmt-opt-refresh*

As mentioned in the section on "Loading" (|txtfmt-loading|), option values are
generally taken into account only at the instant the plugin using them is
sourced. Thus, changes to one of the Txtfmt options discussed below will have
no immediate effect upon a Txtfmt buffer that has already been loaded. If you
have changed option settings and wish to have those changes applied to a
loaded Txtfmt buffer, you have a choice of three methods:

    1) :e[dit]
    This is probably the simplest method. It relies upon a buffer-local
    BufReadPre autocmd, whose job is to ensure that all options will be
    re-processed when the filetype/syntax plugins are reloaded in response to
    the BufRead event.

						*txtfmt-:Refresh*
    2) :Refresh
    :Refresh is a buffer-local command, which may be invoked from any loaded
    Txtfmt buffer. For most practical purposes, this method yields the same
    results as ":e[dit]", although the implementation is significantly
    different (and more complex). In particular, :Refresh does not actually
    re-edit the file, so the various BufRead autocommands will not be
    triggered. It works via assignments to 'filetype' and/or 'syntax', as
    appropriate.

    3) :bd[elete] (followed by re-edit of the file)
    This is arguably the safest method, since a :bdelete unlets all
    buffer-local variables, thus wiping out all "memory" of any previous
    Txtfmt plugin load for the current buffer. Of course, you shouldn't use
    this method if you don't want to lose other (non-Txtfmt) buffer-local
    variables.


Option List					*txtfmt-opt-list*

The following is a comprehensive list of Txtfmt options. In the list below,
the option name as it would appear in a |txtfmt-modeline| is given within
single quotes (''). The variable name used for global or buffer-local
assignments is listed without the leading "g:" or "b:", but is accompanied by
a string such as "global" or "global or buffer-local" to indicate how it may
be set.

						*txtfmtColor{}*
						*txtfmtBgcolor{}*
txtfmtColor{1..8}
txtfmtBgcolor{1..8}	old-style array of strings
			(default: See |txtfmt-color-defaults|)
			global or buffer-local
	These old-style Vim "arrays" allow you to override the default colors
	corresponding to the 8 foreground and 8 background color tokens. It is
	possible to override none, some, or all of the colors. The
	txtfmtBgcolor{} array may be used to configure background colors
	differently from foreground colors. The txtfmtColor{} array applies
	not only to foreground colors, but also to background colors for which
	the corresponding entry in txtfmtBgcolor{} has not been defined.
	Txtfmt considers each color index independently of all others; thus,
	it is possible to set only those elements whose default color you wish
	to override. Note that for a foreground color, "default" in this
	context refers to the default color definition provided by the Txtfmt
	plugin; for a background color, it could also refer to the default
	provided by the txtfmtColor{} array. In other words, you can provide
	overrides for both foreground and background colors in txtfmtColor{},
	then use txtfmtBgcolor{} to override only the subset of background
	colors you wish to differ from their corresponding foreground colors.
	For details on the format of the strings, see |txtfmt-color-config|.

			*txtfmt-'conceal'* *txtfmt-'cncl'* *txtfmtConceal*
'conceal' 'cncl'
txtfmtConceal		boolean (default on when has('conceal') == 1)
			global or buffer-local
			*** New in version 2.0 ***
	This option determines whether Txtfmt will attempt to use the
	concealment capability provided either by the "conceal" feature (Vim
	versions >= 7.3) or by Vince Negri's "conceal / ownsyntax" patch
	(available for older versions of Vim). Note that this option is
	ignored when has("conceal") returns 0.
	Note: You can check to see whether your version of Vim supports the
	"conceal" feature either by executing has('conceal'), or by searching
	the output of :version for the applicable feature string:
		+conceal (enabled)
		-conceal (disabled)

	The ideal Txtfmt token is zero-width, affecting the highlighting of
	subsequent text without taking up any visible space in the Txtfmt
	buffer. Such "zero-width" Txtfmt tokens are the default in versions of
	Vim >= 7.3. In older versions of Vim, zero-width tokens were possible
	only for users who built a custom version of Vim with Vince Negri's
	"conceal / ownsyntax" patch. When the "conceal" feature is enabled,
	Txtfmt will attempt to conceal completely all tokens not in the cursor
	line. (Whether or not tokens in the cursor line are concealed depends
	upon the |txtfmt-'concealcursor'| option setting.)

	When the "conceal" feature is disabled (either by this option or by
	lack of support in Vim), Txtfmt attempts to conceal the special
	formatting tokens by making each appear as a single space character,
	each of which consumes a single column of screen width. Although this
	is typically not an issue when the tokens can be placed at the end of
	a line or on a line by themselves, it can be a source of annoyance in
	certain scenarios. Consider, for example, the case in which you want
	to highlight a single word in red bold. You would need to insert both
	a red fg color and a bold format token prior to the word, and both the
	'no format' and 'no fg color' tokens immediately after the word. Since
	each token appears as a single space, the highlighted word will appear
	to be surrounded by more whitespace than usual. This becomes even more
	of an issue in the unlikely event you wish to highlight only part of a
	particular word. For this reason, Txtfmt will always use the "conceal"
	feature whenever it is available.

	*txtfmt-conceal-notes* *txtfmt-conceal-history*
	*txtfmt-conceal-backwards-compatibility*
	Prior to Vim 7.3, the default setting of the |txtfmt-'conceal'| option
	was "off", even when has("conceal") indicated that the feature was
	enabled in Vim (i.e., because the user had applied Vince Negri's
	"conceal" patch). This design choice was made, in spite of the fact
	that use of the "conceal" feature is optimal, primarily for reasons of
	backwards-compatibility. In particular, as annoying as non-zero-width
	tokens might be, many users were sure to have created files that
	relied upon the tokens' width to achieve proper indenting. A 4 space
	leading indent, for instance, might have been realized with a bold
	format token followed by 3 spaces. Suddenly concealing the bold format
	token would break the alignment.

	Although this rationale is still valid, it is no longer sufficient (in
	my judgment) to justify disabling the "conceal" feature by default,
	now that the feature has been incorporated into Vim itself. First-time
	Txtfmt users who begin using the plugin with Vim 7.3 will naturally
	expect the plugin to take advantage of the "conceal" feature without
	any explicit action on their part. Such users might not even be aware
	of the existence of this option. Presenting Txtfmt in a sub-optimal
	light (i.e., without "conceal" functionality) would increase the
	probability that such users would abandon use of the plugin before
	becoming sufficiently familiar with its documentation to learn that
	they had the power to enable the "conceal" feature with a simple
	option setting.

	*txtfmt-viewing-old-files-without-conceal*
	If you have legacy files that are best viewed without the "conceal"
	feature, but you're using a version of Vim with compiled-in support
	for "conceal", you may wish to view the old files with "noconceal",
	and view all newly-created Txtfmt files with "conceal". This is easily
	accomplished as follows...

	1. Set txtfmtConceal true globally, either by leaving the option at
	   its default, or setting it explicitly in your vimrc. E.g.,
		let g:txtfmtConceal = 1

	2. Use Txtfmt modelines in your old files to disable the "conceal"
	   feature for those files only. E.g.,
		txtfmt:noconceal

	Note: If you have many old files, you might wish to automate the
	addition of the modelines with a simple sed or awk script: E.g.,

	find . -iname '*.txtfmt' | xargs sed -i -e '$a\' -e 'txtfmt:noconceal'

	Explanation: Adds a Txtfmt-modeline disabling "conceal" on the last
	line of all .txtfmt files recursively under the current directory.
	Note: Txtfmt will process up to |txtfmtModelines| modelines at the
	beginning or end of a file; thus, the command above simply adds a new
	modeline without bothering to check for an existing one.

	Of course, the strategy outlined above is merely a suggestion. You can
	use a combination of Txtfmt modeline and buffer-local / global option
	settings to achieve whatever behavior you desire.

		*txtfmt-'concealcursor'* *txtfmt-'cocu'* *txtfmtConcealcursor*
'concealcursor' 'cocu'
txtfmtConcealcursor	string (default: "nvic")
			global or buffer-local
			*** New in version 2.4 ***
	Important Note: The default value of this option may change in a
	future version of Txtfmt. If you care about its value, you should set
	it explicitly.

	Note: This option is ignored when the "conceal" feature is disabled
	(via the |txtfmt-'conceal'| option) or is not supported by the running
	Vim instance.

	This option determines whether Txtfmt tokens in the line containing
	the cursor are concealed. Its value is a string of single character
	flags indicating the modes for which tokens in the cursor line should
	be concealed. The flags are defined as follows in the Vim help:

	  n		Normal mode
	  v		Visual mode
	  i		Insert mode
	  c		Command line editing, for 'incsearch'
		
	For detailed descriptions, see Vim help on 'concealcursor'...

	Note: Some new users might be disconcerted by the fact that with the
	default setting of this option, the tokens disappear as soon as they
	are entered. (After all, he might wish to delete them at some point.)
	This will not be a concern at all once visual maps (targeted for next
	release) have been added. These maps will automate addition/removal of
	tokens completely, such that the user needn't even be aware of the
	tokens' existence. In the meantime, however, the best way to locate
	existing tokens does not require you to see them: it involves use of
	the |txtfmt-jump-to-tok| maps, which facilitate locating Txtfmt tokens
	by their types; additionally, the |\ga| map (|txtfmt-get-tok-info|)
	may be used to learn the nature of the token under the cursor, even
	when the token is completely concealed (i.e., occupying zero width).

				*txtfmt-'escape'* *txtfmt-'esc'* *txtfmtEscape*
'escape' 'esc'
txtfmtEscape		string (default: "none")
			global or buffer-local
	This option determines how (if at all) the special format/color tokens
	may be escaped in a Txtfmt buffer. Escaping would be necessary only in
	the unlikely event that you needed to use the special tokens in a file
	for a non-Txtfmt purpose. Hopefully, you have chosen a value for
	|txtfmt-'tokrange'| that renders this unnecessary. If so, it is safe
	to leave this option at its default value: "none". The following
	values are possible:
		bslash	Escape a format/color token with backslash ('\')
		self	Escape a format/color token with itself (i.e., by
			doubling the special chars)
		none	No escaping of format/color tokens
	Note: Escaping characters themselves may be escaped, but only when
	they appear in an unbroken sequence immediately preceding a Txtfmt
	token. Examples for both the "bslash" and "self" cases are shown
	below...

	--bslash--
	\<fb>             Escaped bold format token
	\\<fb>            Backslash followed by bold format token
	\\\<fb>           Backslash followed by escaped bold format token
	--self--
	<fb><fb>          Escaped bold format token
	<fb><fb><fb>      Escaped bold format token followed by bold format token
	<fb><fb><fb><fb>  Escaped bold format token followed by escaped bold
	                  format token
	Note: When a Txtfmt token is escaped, the escaping character will be
	hidden, and the escaped character should be highlighted just like the
	surrounding text.

		    *txtfmt-'fgcolormask'* *txtfmt-'fcm'* *txtfmtFgcolormask*
		    *txtfmt-'bgcolormask'* *txtfmt-'bcm'* *txtfmtBgcolormask*
'fgcolormask' 'fcm'
txtfmtFgcolormask	string (default: "11111111")
			global or buffer-local
			*** New in version 2.0 ***
'bgcolormask' 'bcm'
txtfmtBgcolormask	string (default: "01101000")
			global or buffer-local
			*** New in version 2.0 ***

	These options permit you to deactivate colors you do not wish to view
	in your Txtfmt buffer. Typically, colors are deactivated for
	performance reasons. (See |txtfmt-performance-considerations|.) Each
	option is a string containing exactly 8 characters. Each of the 8
	characters corresponds to one of the 8 possible colors in the
	corresponding color definition array. (For information on color
	definition arrays, see help on |txtfmtColor{}|.) The first character
	in the string corresponds to the first element in the color array. The
	meaning of the mask characters is as follows:
	"1"	activates the color
	"0"	deactivates the color

	Consider the bgcolormask default as an example: 01101000
	This mask enables the colors corresponding to indices 2, 3 and 5 in
	the background color definition array. In the default color definition
	arrays, these indices correspond to blue, green and red, respectively.
	For performance reasons, I enable only these 3 most commonly used
	background colors by default. Feel free to enable an entirely
	different set of colors if you like. For backward-compatibility
	reasons, the default fgcolormask enables all foreground colors.
	However, if you notice there are foreground colors that you never use,
	you can deactivate them to speed up the syntax redrawing.

	Note: Deactivating a color does not alter a Txtfmt buffer in any way.
	The character code corresponding to the deactivated color continues to
	be reserved within the Txtfmt token range; it simply has no effect on
	highlighting.

						*txtfmtJumptoinactive*
txtfmtJumptoinactive	boolean (default off)
			global or buffer-local
	This option determines whether the |txtfmt-jump-to-tok| maps will
	treat an inactive (masked) fg or bg color token as the target of a
	jump. By default, only tokens that affect the highlighting of the
	Txtfmt buffer will be considered as potential jump targets.
	Note: Currently, this option may be set at any time; i.e., a change
	will take effect even after the plugin has loaded. This behavior is
	subject to change.

						*txtfmtMapwarn*
txtfmtMapwarn		string (default: "mMoOcC")
			global
	This option determines what the Txtfmt filetype plugin does when one
	of its default 1st level maps is either ambiguous or conflicting with
	an existing map. For an explanation of 1st and 2nd level maps, see
	|txtfmt-map-config|. For a description of the character flags
	comprising the option value, see |txtfmt-map-conflict|.

						*txtfmtModelines*
txtfmtModelines		number (default: 5)
			global or buffer-local
	This option is analogous to Vim's 'modelines' option. It determines
	how many (if any) lines at the beginning and end of a file will be
	searched for a |txtfmt-modeline|. For (hopefully) obvious reasons, it
	cannot be set from a txtfmt-modeline.

			*txtfmt-'nested'* *txtfmt-'nst'* *txtfmtNested*
'nested' 'nst'
txtfmtNested		boolean (default on)
			global or buffer-local
	This option determines whether Txtfmt regions can be nested within
	non-txtfmt regions. If you are not sure what this means, see
	|txtfmt-nesting|.

			*txtfmt-'pack'* *txtfmt-'pck'* *txtfmtPack*
'pack' 'pck'
txtfmtPack		boolean (default on)
			global or buffer-local
			*** New in version 2.0 ***
	This option determines the offset within the Txtfmt token range where
	the background color tokens are located. By default, the background
	color tokens are "packed" up against the end of the format token
	range. In other words, space within the range is not reserved for the
	inactive "long" format tokens. Currently, there is little reason to
	reserve space for inactive "long" format tokens: you cannot have both
	"long" formats and background colors in the same buffer. Moreover,
	there are backward-compatibility concerns that dictate the packing of
	background color tokens. There are, however, several reasons you might
	wish to leave space for "long" format tokens, even if you're not
	currently using them. It is recommended that you read the following
	section for details: |txtfmt-upgrading-to-extended-long-formats|

	Note: This option is meaningful only if the tokrange suffix is 'X'
	(extended).

						*txtfmt-'sync'* *txtfmtSync*
'sync'
txtfmtSync		string or number (default: 250)
			global or buffer-local
	This option determines the method used to perform syntax
	synchronization on a Txtfmt buffer. (For an overview of syntax
	synchronization, see |:syn-sync|.)

	Possible values:
	    fromstart	Syncing always starts at the beginning of the Txtfmt
			buffer. This is the most accurate, but least efficient
			method.
	    none	Syncing is not performed at all. This method is
			extremely fast, but may produce incorrect highlighting
			for Txtfmt regions that begin prior to the first
			visible screen line.
	    {number}	Works as though a "minlines={number}" argument has
			been supplied to Vim's |:syn-sync| command.
			(See |:syn-sync-minlines|for more information.)

	Set examples: >
	    let g:txtfmtSync = "fromstart"
	    let g:txtfmtSync = 500

	    " In a modeline...
	    txtfmt:sync=none
	    txtfmt:sync=100
<

			*txtfmt-'tokrange'* *txtfmt-'rng'* *txtfmtTokrange*
			*txtfmt-starttok* *txtfmt-formats*
'tokrange' 'rng'
txtfmtTokrange		string or Vim expression evaluating to string
			(default:
				1 byte encoding: "180X"
				2 byte encoding: "180X"
				unicode:         "0xE000X")
			format: {number}[{formats}]
			global or buffer-local
	This option allows the user to specify both the location of the range
	of characters dedicated to Txtfmt and the types of highlighting
	regions that may be created: {number} specifies the character code of
	the first character in the range; {formats}, if specified, is a single
	letter indicating the types of regions supported. The following values
	are supported:
	    'S' ("short" formats)
	    'L' ("long" formats)
	    'X' ("extended")
	All 3 modes suppport up to 8 foreground colors. Short format mode
	supports only the bold, underline and italic format attributes,
	whereas long formats adds to this basic set the standout and reverse
	(inverse) attributes, and if the version of Vim in use supports it,
	the undercurl attribute. Extended mode is equivalent to short formats
	with the addition of up to 8 background colors. Note that for
	performance reasons, you are currently not permitted to enable both
	long formats and background colors. If you wish to know why (and
	whether this restriction will ever be lifted), see
	|txtfmt-upgrading-to-extended-long-formats|.

	The table below provides a convenient illustration of the effect each
	{formats} value has on the set of supported highlight attributes.

                       {--{formats}--}
        +-------------------------------+          
        |              S      L      X  |  
        +-------------------------------+
        |underline     Y      Y      Y  |
        |bold          Y      Y      Y  |
        |italic        Y      Y      Y  |
        |standout      -      Y      -  |
        |reverse*      -      Y      -  |
        |undercurl     -      Y*     -  |
        +-------------------------------+
        |fg_clrs     <=8    <=8    <=8  |
        |bg_clrs       -      -    <=8* |
        +-------------------------------+

	*Note: "Reverse" is another name for "inverse".
        *Note: Versions of Vim prior to 7.0 did not support the undercurl
	attribute; thus, Txtfmt will automatically disable undercurl if it
	detects a Vim version < 7.0.
	*Note: By default, only 3 background colors are enabled. You may
	enable more with the |txtfmt-'bgcolormask'| option.

	If you omit the optional {formats} suffix, Txtfmt assumes the default
	of 'X'. The suffixes are all case-insensitive.

						*txtfmt-'tokrange'-expr*
	Note: If the option string is not a valid 'tokrange' string, Txtfmt
	will attempt to evaluate the option string as a Vim expression. If
	this evaluation produces a valid 'tokrange' value, Txtfmt will use it;
	otherwise, Txtfmt will display error and use a default setting. This
	feature permits you to defer the choice of 'tokrange' until a
	particular file is being loaded. (Alternatively, you could defer
	choosing 'tokrange' by performing buf-local sets within autocommands
	or by using a |txtfmt-modeline|.) >
	Example:
		let g:txtfmtTokrange = 'MyTokrangeChooser()'
		let g:txtfmtTokrange = '&enc == "utf-8" ? "0xE000X" : "180X"' 
<

	If you do not specify this option, either in a |txtfmt-modeline| or
	via the txtfmtTokrange option variable, Txtfmt will attempt to choose
	a suitable default. However, you should probably not let Txtfmt choose
	a default for an option as important as this one. It is recommended
	that you read |txtfmt-choosing-token-range| before setting this
	option. Moreover, it is recommended that you use the :MakeTestPage
	command to test whatever setting you ultimately choose. (See
	|txtfmt-:MakeTestPage|.)

			*txtfmt-'undercurl'* *txtfmt-'uc'* *txtfmtUndercurl*
'undercurl' 'uc'
txtfmtUndercurl		boolean (default on if running Vim supports undercurl)
			global or buffer-local
			*** New in version 2.0 ***
	Txtfmt disables use of the undercurl attribute automatically for
	versions of Vim that don't support it (i.e., Vim versions older than
	7.0). Turning this option off prevents the creation of undercurl
	regions, even when the running version of Vim does support it. You
	might wish to do this for performance reasons if you use "long"
	formats but rarely if ever use undercurl. Disabling undercurl cuts the
	number of format tokens in the Txtfmt token range in half. Of course,
	the token reduction is not as significant as the associated runtime
	performance improvement, especially if you're using Unicode, in which
	character codes are plentiful. For a more detailed look at performance
	considerations, read |txtfmt-performance-considerations|.

	As is the case with color masks, setting or clearing this option does
	not alter a Txtfmt buffer in any way; it merely alters its syntax
	highlighting. Thus, there is nothing to prevent you from disabling
	undercurl until you find you have need of it. Suppose, for example,
	you have recently upgraded to the current version of Vim from a
	pre-7.0 version (i.e., one that doesn't support undercurl). Suppose
	further that you've been managing without undercurl, and you're not
	sure you really need it. You could put a line such as... >
	let g:txtfmtUndercurl = 0
<
	...in your vimrc to disable undercurl globally until you decide you're
	ready to use it. Alternatively, you may decide you want to use
	undercurl right away, but you have a number of legacy files, created
	under the old version of Vim, which do not have undercurl regions and
	probably never will. To avoid paying a performance penalty when
	viewing these legacy files, you could add the following Txtfmt
	modeline to the legacy files: >
		txtfmt:nouc
<
	Caveat: For backward-compatibility reasons, disabled undercurl tokens
	are not considered to be part of the Txtfmt token range in the same
	way that disabled color tokens are. This fact has implications for the
	|txtfmt-:MoveStartTok| command, which will not attempt to translate
	characters corresponding to disabled undercurl tokens. Another
	implication of this fact is that you will not be warned if you choose
	a |txtfmt-'tokrange'| setting that does not leave room for undercurl
	tokens at the end of the range. Of course, this is not really an
	issue, since if you did eventually decide to enable undercurl in such
	a case, you could simply run the :MoveStartTok command to translate
	the entire token range leftward, thereby making room for the undercurl
	tokens.
	
						*txtfmtUsermap{}*
txtfmtUsermap{}		old-style array of strings
			(default: none)
			global or buffer-local
	This old-style Vim "array" allows you to build your own complex
	mappings from Txtfmt primitives, by using a powerful mechanism known
	as "Txtfmt user-maps". The user-map mechanism is described in detail
	in section |txtfmt-user-maps|.
	Note: First element of the array is at index 1.

						*txtfmtUsermaplimit*
txtfmtUsermaplimit	number (default: 25)
			global or buffer-local
	Defines the number of elements of txtfmtUsermap{} (described above)
	that will be tested for valid user-map definitions.

CHOOSING A TOKEN RANGE				*txtfmt-choosing-token-range*

						*txtfmt-encoding*
Before choosing a value for the |txtfmt-'tokrange'| option, you should
consider what character encoding you will be using. Because of the sheer
number of available character codes, utf-8 is perhaps the ideal encoding for
use with Txtfmt.

						*'short'/'long'-formats*
The number of character codes that must be dedicated to Txtfmt usage depends
upon the setting of txtfmt-'tokrange'. The number of tokens required for
format attributes is given by 2^N, where "N" is the number of format
attributes (e.g., bold, underline, etc...). As mentioned in the help for the
|txtfmt-'tokrange'| option, N will be 3 if "short" or "extended" formats are
selected and either 5 or 6 if "long" formats are used. All tokrange settings
require exactly 9 tokens to be reserved for foreground colors. If background
colors have been enabled ("extended" formats), an additional 9 tokens are
reserved. The following table illustrates the character range requirements
graphically.
Note: The undercurl column indicates whether the undercurl attribute is
active. It will be "on" if the version of the running Vim is >= 7.0 AND
undercurl has not been explicitly disabled via the |txtfmt-'undercurl'|
option.

  +--------+-----------+------------+
  | suffix | undercurl | num tokens |
  +--------+-----------+------------+
  |   S    |   NA      |    17      |
  |   X    |   NA      |    26      |
  |   L    |   off     |    41      |
  |   L    |   on      |    73      |
  +--------+-----------+------------+


When I wrote the initial version of the Txtfmt plugin, only the "short" format
attributes (bold, underline and italic) were supported. Accordingly, only 17
tokens needed to be dedicated to Txtfmt usage. At that time, I assumed that
only ASCII characters would be used for text. (The initial version of Txtfmt
was actually called "ascfmt"!) Since that time, my mindset has grown a bit
more global, and I now envision Txtfmt usage with a wide variety of character
encodings. If Txtfmt is configured for use with all possible format attributes
(bold, underline, italic, standout, reverse and undercurl), the Txtfmt token
requirement jumps to 73. Although it is possible for many English speakers
using a "latin1" encoding to forego the use of 73 character codes in the range
128-255, Europeans may find this restriction unacceptable, given the presence
of a number of accented characters in that range. If you're using a multibyte
character set such as Unicode, you should have no difficulty finding an unused
sequence of 73 characters to dedicate to Txtfmt. (Hint: see
|txtfmt-private-use-area| below.)

					*txtfmt-performance-considerations*
The number of character codes dedicated to Txtfmt usage is not the only factor
you should consider when choosing a |txtfmt-'tokrange'| setting. The tokrange
setting also determines the number of syntax regions Txtfmt must define in
order to accomplish the desired highlighting. The number of syntax regions, in
turn, directly affects the speed with which Vim can load and redraw a Txtfmt
buffer. Consider, as an example, the choice between "short" and "long"
formats. Although it supports only 3 additional format attributes, the "long"
formats configuration requires roughly 10 times as many syntax regions as
"short" formats! This increase in the number of syntax regions engenders a
significant increase in CPU overhead consumed by syntax highlighting, even
when the additional format attributes are not used, since Vim must spend time
checking the unused region definitions. On some systems, the performance
penalty is large enough to render display of "long" formats noticeably
sluggish.

With the addition of "extended" formats (i.e., background colors) in Txtfmt
version 2.0, performance considerations have become even more significant. The
addition of 8 background colors to the "short" formats baseline results in a
thirty-fold increase in the number of syntax regions! (Hint: The dramatic
increase is due to the "orthogonality" of the various types of regions.)
Fortunately, Txtfmt allows you to reduce the number of syntax regions
considerably (thereby increasing load/redraw speed) by "de-activating" unused
colors. Consider that the typical user may never use more than 3 or 4 colors
in his Txtfmt buffers. If Txtfmt knows in advance which colors are used, it
can avoid defining syntax regions for the unused ones. Note that the tokens
corresponding to these inactive colors will still be reserved by Txtfmt, since
if the token range were "collapsed" on top of unused color tokens, it would be
impossible (or at least difficult) to re-activate the colors later when, for
example, the user got a faster computer and decided he might occasionally use
the extra colors.

Txtfmt provides the following 2 "color mask" options to permit you to
enable foreground and background colors independently:
        |txtfmt-'fgcolormask'|
        |txtfmt-'bgcolormask'|
If you don't define these options, Txtfmt will enable all 8 foreground colors,
and the 3 background colors corresponding to red, green and blue in the
default color configuration.

                                                *txtfmt-syn-rgn-count-table*
The following table is intended to aid you in choosing your
|txtfmt-'tokrange'| suffix and fg/bg color masks, by showing the number of
syntax regions required for various configurations and numbers of active fg/bg
colors. The list is intended to be representative, not exhaustive.
Note: To facilitate comparison, the table rows are presented in order of
increasing syntax region counts.

  +--------+-----------+-----------+------------+
  | suffix | # fg clrs | # bg clrs | # syn rgns |
  +--------+-----------+-----------+------------+
  |   S    |     8     |     NA    |    142     |
  |   L*   |     8     |     NA    |    574     |  * no undercurl
  |   L    |     4     |     NA    |    638     |
  |   X    |     5     |     2     |    684     |
  |   X    |     4     |     4     |    990     |
  |   L    |     8     |     NA    |    1150    |
  |   X    |     8     |     3     |    1448    |
  |   X    |     8     |     4     |    1846    |
  |   X    |     6     |     6     |    2030    |
  |   X    |     8     |     8     |    3438    |
  +--------+-----------+-----------+------------+
                                               
                                                *txtfmt-upgrading-tokrange*
If you don't currently need background colors or "long" formats and thus are
considering the use of "short" formats because of the reduced token
requirement, but suspect that you may eventually want to use either "long"
format attributes or background colors, it may be reassuring to know that the
implementation has been designed to permit a seamless "upgrade" from "short"
to "long" or "extended" formats.

As an example, consider a Txtfmt file with the following |txtfmt-modeline|: >
	txtfmt:tokrange=180S

This file will use tokens in the range 180-196 to support 8 colors as well as
all combinations of bold, underline and italic attributes. If you decide at
some point that you would like to begin using standout, reverse and undercurl
attributes in this file, simply change the modeline to the following: >
	txtfmt:tokrange=180L

The original (bold, underline and italic) regions will be unaffected, but you
will now be able to create regions with all 63 combinations of format
attributes. The cost is an extra 56 character codes that will be unavailable
for normal text usage. The expanded range of characters used by Txtfmt is now
180-252.

Alternatively, if you were content with bold, underline and italic format
attributes, but wished to add background colors to your buffer, you could have
upgraded from "short" to "extended" with the following modeline: >
	txtfmt:tokrange=180X
<

                                *txtfmt-upgrading-to-extended-long-formats*
                                *txtfmtAllowxl*
It should be pointed out that the default location for background color tokens
is just past the end of the "short" format tokens. Note that this is precisely
where the "long" format tokens would be located. Ideally, since the format
token range is the only variable-length range, the background color tokens
would have been located before it. Such a strategy would have permitted the
user to switch freely back and forth between "extended" and "long" formats
without the need to move or delete any existing background color tokens.
Unfortunately, for reasons of backward-compatibility, the background color
tokens had to go after all other tokens. The reason is that earlier versions
of Txtfmt, which didn't support background colors at all, used a default for
tokrange that puts the first token at the very beginning of Unicode's Private
Use Area. Locating background color tokens at the head of the token range,
therefore, would require users to translate the tokens at least 9 characters
rightward in their existing files if they wished to use background colors.
This was out of the question, as one of my design goals for version 2.0 was to
ensure that a user who wished to add background colors to a buffer created
with an older version of Txtfmt would be able to do so simply, i.e., without
the need for special upgrade steps.

The fact that background color and "long" format tokens occupy overlapping
ranges means that, by default, you can't have both background colors and long
formats active in the same buffer. Of course, it would have been possible to
locate the background color tokens after the long token range, leaving the
long tokens reserved but unused when only "short" formats are active. Although
this strategy would support simultaneously active long formats and background
colors, it would have broken backward compatibility. The reason is that the
default tokrange for the latin1 encoding is such that there is not enough room
after the final long format token for the range of background color tokens.
Thus, users with existing files that use the default tokrange would be
required to translate their entire token range at least 9 characters leftward
prior to enabling background colors. In light of the previously stated design
goals, this was unacceptable. Thus, by default, the background color tokens
are "packed" in just after the short format tokens. It is possible, however,
to override this default behavior by clearing the |txtfmt-'pack'| option. When
this option is turned off, the background color tokens will be located after
the range reserved for long format tokens, even when the configuration is such
that long formats are disabled.

Why would you ever wish to clear the |txtfmt-'pack'| option? Well, there are
two possible motivations:
1. You're not initially sure whether you would prefer to have background
   colors or long formats.
   Example scenario: You're currently using "extended" formats, but you've
   done a lot of editing and have inserted only a handful of background
   colors. Moreover, you've found yourself wishing more than once for the
   undercurl attribute. At this point, you could simply change the tokrange
   suffix from 'X' to 'L' and begin using undercurl. If |txtfmt-'pack'| had
   been set when you added the background color tokens, those tokens would now
   be interpreted as long format tokens, thereby introducing unwanted format
   regions. Since |txtfmt-'pack'| was clear, however, they are located
   harmlessly beyond the end of the Txtfmt token range, and will therefore
   have no effect.
2. You know that one day Txtfmt will support the 'XL' (extended long) tokrange
   suffix, and you want to create files that will be able to transition
   seamlessly from 'X' or 'L' to 'XL'.
   Note: Unofficially, Txtfmt already does support the 'XL' suffix, but it is
   currently disabled for performance reasons. If you're wondering why, you
   may be interested to know that the 'XL' suffix requires 28633 syntax
   regions!!! On my machine, Vim crashes if I attempt to use 'XL' formats with
   all foreground and background colors enabled! I can get it to load without
   crashing by de-activating several colors, but even then, syntax definitions
   are sometimes silently corrupted, apparently because Vim has run out of
   memory for storing them. For this reason, I do not advertise support for
   'XL', and in fact it is disallowed by default. However, if you set the
   global |txtfmtAllowxl| option to a nonzero value before attempting to load
   Txtfmt, you will be able to set suffix to 'XL'. (If you do, you may wish to
   go make a pot of coffee while you wait for the file to load, and if Vim
   crashes while you're gone, don't say I didn't warn you...;-)

						*txtfmt-start-token*
						*txtfmt-private-use-area*
If you're using Unicode, the "Private Use Area" (a block of character codes
beginning at 0xE000) is probably the ideal location for the Txtfmt token
range. This block is reserved for "application-specific" use, and is
guaranteed never to be used for actual characters.

						*txtfmt-multibyte-syntax-bug*
Note: Several beta-release versions of Txtfmt did not work correctly with
multibyte encodings because of a Vim bug involving the treatment of offsets
used in syntax highlight matches. A patch for the Vim bug was created by
Yukihiro Nakadaira, and was included in the Txtfmt distribution. Only users
who applied the patch were able to use Txtfmt with a multibyte encoding such
as utf-8. As of Txtfmt version 1.1, however, the patch was no longer
necessary, as workaround logic had been added to Txtfmt itself. Moreover,
Yukihiro's patch has been incorporated into Vim 7.2, so Txtfmt's internal
workaround is required only for older versions of Vim. There is, however, one
_extremely_ rare scenario in which someone running a version of Vim older than
7.2 might wish to apply the patch: namely, when different characters within
tokrange are encoded with different numbers of bytes. Since the number of
bytes per character is usually constant across a large block of Unicode
characters, only users wishing to set tokrange to a very non-standard value
would be affected by this limitation. All of the default tokrange settings
work properly with no need for the patch. Thus, as of Txtfmt version 1.5, I'm
removing Yukihiro's patch from the distribution (to avoid frightening away new
users;-). If you determine that you need it, you can obtain it from a Txtfmt
version <= 1.4. Note, however, that you should never need this patch if you're
running Vim 7.2 or later.

						*txtfmt-problematic-ranges*
Not all character codes are suitable for use as Txtfmt tokens. In particular,
only tokens that are susceptible to Vim's syntax highlighting should be used.
For a color terminal, characters used in terminal control sequences are
sometimes immune to syntax highlighting. The specific character code ranges
affected will vary from terminal to terminal. For latin1 and utf-8 encodings,
characters in the range 0x80-0xA0 should generally be avoided, as they tend to
cause problems in both GUI and terminal versions of Vim. (Exception: The
Windows GUI appears to be able to handle this range.) For utf-8 encodings,
only 16-bit character codes should be used, as Vim does not display characters
above 0xFFFF correctly. Note that not all 16-bit values correspond to a valid
Unicode character. The ones that do not will be displayed as <xxxx> (where
xxxx is the hexadecimal representation of the character code). These
"characters" cannot be highlighted and should not be used.

As a general rule, modern unix-style terminals tend to work best when Unicode
is used. I have found by experimentation that some ranges of tokens work
perfectly when 'encoding' is set to utf-8, but don't work at all when it is
set to latin1. The bottom-line is, if you're using a color terminal designed
to work with Unicode, you should probably keep 'encoding' at utf-8. If for
some reason you must use a different encoding, you should experiment with the
|txtfmt-:MakeTestPage| command to find a setting for |txtfmt-'tokrange'| that
works.

						*txtfmt-default-tokrange*
If you do not explicitly set the |txtfmt-'tokrange'| option, either in a
|txtfmt-modeline| or via the |txtfmtTokrange| option variable, Txtfmt will
attempt to choose a default setting that is suitable for the current character
encoding. Success in this endeavor is not guaranteed, however, since it
involves choosing a range of characters that will not be used for any other
purpose in the file being edited. For Unicode, the task of choosing a suitable
range is simple, due to the existence of the "Private Use Area".

Backward-compatibility Note: Because versions of Vim prior to 7.2 handled
syntax highlighting match offsets incorrectly for multibyte characters,
versions of Txtfmt prior to 1.1 would not choose a tokrange default within the
"Private Use Area", even for Unicode encodings such as utf-8. Txtfmt version
1.1, however, contained a workaround that permitted multibyte tokens to be
used even in versions of Vim suffering from the aforementioned bug. Thus, in
Txtfmt version 1.1, the default start token for Unicode changed from 180 to
0xE000 (the start of the "Private Use Area").

Important Note: If you are a multibyte encoding user who created Txtfmt files
with the old start token value of 180, you should consider the following
(non-exhaustive) list of options...
	1. Continue using 180 for all Txtfmt files.
	   How: Override the new default by setting the |txtfmtTokrange|
	   option explicitly.
        2. Continue using 180 for existing files, but use 0xE000 for all
           newly-created Txtfmt files.
           How: Put a |txtfmt-modeline| containing (e.g.) "tokrange=180X" in
           your existing Txtfmt files to override the new default. 
	3. Use 0xE000 for all Txtfmt files, old and new.
	   How: Use the :MoveStartTok command to relocate the tokens in your
	   existing file(s) to a new range within the "Private Use Area".
	   e.g. >
		   :MoveStartTok 0xE000
<
	   For more information, see |txtfmt-:MoveStartTok|

For encodings other than Unicode, there is nothing analogous to the "Private
Use Area"; hence, it is not possible to choose a default tokrange that will
work for everyone. Currently, Txtfmt's default algorithm chooses '180X' for
all 1 and 2 byte encodings. This value should be suitable for most
non-European users of a single byte encoding such as latin1. European users
who use accented letters located at or above character code 180 should
probably be using a multibyte encoding such as utf-8.

Although the tokrange defaults should be suitable for the vast majority of
users, they may not be suitable for everyone, and each Txtfmt user is
encouraged to put some thought into the tokrange he will use and then test it
thoroughly with :MakeTestPage. For usage details, see |txtfmt-:MakeTestPage|.


COLORS						*txtfmt-color-config*

IMPORTANT NOTE: This section makes no attempt to distinguish between
foreground and background colors. The description of the |txtfmtColor{}| array
applies equally to the|txtfmtBgcolor{}| array, which permits background colors
to be configured independently of their foreground color counterparts.

As mentioned previously, there are 9 tokens used to begin Txtfmt color
regions: 8 corresponding to colors, and 1 indicating "default" or "no color".
By default, Txtfmt picks these colors according to RGB values: #000000
(black), #0000FF (blue), #00FF00 (green), etc... However, this choice may not
be desirable for all users; hence, Txtfmt provides a rather flexible mechanism
by which the user can configure the colors used. In fact, the user can
configure different sets of colors for different color terminals, GUI's, or
colorschemes. The configuration is accomplished via the old-style Vim array
txtfmtColor{1..8}, which may be set either buf-locally or globally. If a given
element has both a buf-local and a global setting, the buf-local setting is
given priority. This array has a static counterpart, initialized to default
values by Txtfmt, so the user can override only those elements he wishes to
change.

Each element of the txtfmtColor{} array corresponds to 1 of the 8 possible
colors. Its value is a string consisting of at least 2 comma-separated parts.
The first part is a Vim regular expression that determines how the color may
be specified in a "color spec". (See |txtfmt-clr-spec| for more information.)
Each of the subsequent parts contains a prefix indicating whether the
definition applies to cterm's or GUI's, an optional list of patterns
specifying the applicable values of 'term', and the actual color string to be
used as the rhs of a "ctermfg=" or "guifg=" in a :highlight command.

Here is the formal definition of a single string in the txtfmtColor{} array:
{namepat},{clrdef1}[,{clrdef2},...,{clrdefN}]

    {clrdef} :=
	    {c|g}[{termpatlist}]:{clrstr}

	    {termpatlist} :=
		    :{termpat1}:{termpat2}:...:{termpatN}

Here are the meanings of the fields:
{namepat}  Vim regex used to recognize the name used to specify a certain
           color; e.g., when prompted by one of the insert token maps. May not
           contain spaces or commas. (Example: 'k\\|bla\\%[ck]')
{c|g}      Determines whether {clrstr} will be the rhs of a "ctermfg=" ('c'),
           or "guifg=" ('g')
{termpat}  Pattern used to match against &term option. It is a regex pattern
           which will be applied as ^{termpat}$.
           Note: The {termpatlist} is optional. If it is omitted, the color
           definition will apply to all cterm's or gui's, as determined by
           {c|g}.
{clrstr}   rhs of a "ctermfg=" or "guifg=" assignment. For possible values,
           see |gui-colors| and |cterm-colors| in the Vim help.

Note: When multiple {clrdef}'s could apply, the rightmost one is used.
Note: {namepat}, {termpat} and {clrstr} fields will have one level of
backslashes removed during processing. Commas, colons and backslashes
appearing within those fields should be preceded with a single backslash. (See
examples below...)

Example txtfmtColor{} elements: >
    'red,c:xterm:dosterm:DarkRed,g:#FF0000,g:builtin_gui:other_gui:#FF1010'
    '^b\\%[lue]$,c:DarkBlue,g:#0000FF'
<

Color defaults					*txtfmt-color-defaults*

The default values for the 8 colors are given below: >
	txtfmtColor{1} = '^\\%(k\\|bla\\%[ck]\\)$,c:Black,g:#000000'
	txtfmtColor{2} = '^b\\%[lue]$,c:DarkBlue,g:#0000FF'
	txtfmtColor{3} = '^g\\%[reen]$,c:DarkGreen,g:#00FF00'
	txtfmtColor{4} = '^t\\%[urquoise]$,c:DarkCyan,g:#00FFFF'
	txtfmtColor{5} = '^r\\%[ed]$,c:DarkRed,g:#FF0000'
	txtfmtColor{6} = '^v\\%[iolet]$,c:DarkMagenta,g:#FF00FF'
	txtfmtColor{7} = '^y\\%[ellow]$,c:DarkYellow,g:#FFFF00'
	txtfmtColor{8} = '^w\\%[hite]$,c:White,g:#FFFFFF'

You may override none, some or all of the defaults. It is even permissible to
override only part of an element; you could, for example, override the
definition of "red" for a "dosterm" color terminal, but use the default red
definition for other cterm's and GUI's.

Colorscheme considerations			*txtfmt-colorschemes*

Although the simplest way to override the default colors is to set the global
version of txtfmtColor{} once and for all in your vimrc, there may be times
when this simple solution is inadequate. Consider the following scenario...
You use Txtfmt to create some blue text in a buffer with a light background.
You later decide you wish to view the Txtfmt buffer with the "blue"
colorscheme. The blue text you created is no longer visible! Of course, you
can make it visible again by redefining the "blue" element in the global
txtfmtColor{} array and re-editing or :Refresh'ing the Txtfmt buffer (see
|txtfmt-:Refresh|), but changing g:txtfmtColor{} everytime you change
colorschemes could become tedious. A better solution is to use autocommands to
change the color definitions automatically whenever the colorscheme changes.
Although you could set the global version of txtfmtColor{} in the autocommand,
setting the buf-local version instead lets you reserve the global version for
defaults that will be used with filetypes for which an autocommand has not
been defined.

For the sake of example, let us assume that you use Txtfmt to edit *.txt
files, and that you wish to vary the color definitions according to current
colorscheme for all such files. To keep the example simple, I will consider
only the following 3 cases:

	1. "default" colorscheme
		Txtfmt defaults are acceptable
	2. "blue" and "darkblue" colorscheme
		Change black to orange
		Change blue to brown
	3. all other colorschemes
		Change black to orange
		Leave blue at the Txtfmt default

The following sample implementation shows one possible strategy for
configuring the Txtfmt colors as described above...
>
	" --INSIDE YOUR USER FILETYPE.VIM--
	augroup filetypedetect
		au! ColorScheme        *.txt    call Define_colors(1)
		au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt    call Define_colors(0)
		au  BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt    setfiletype txtfmt
	augroup END
<
-------------------------------
Explanation of the autocommands
-------------------------------
All assignments to the buf-local txtfmtColor{} array occur within the
Define_colors function (shown below). A call to Define_colors has been placed
in a BufRead,BufNewFile autocommand to ensure that colors can be set
appropriately even when :colorscheme has never been called. The call from
within the ColorScheme autocommand ensures that the colors are recomputed
whenever the colorscheme is changed. >
Note: It is not necessary that the ColorScheme autocommand be placed within
the filetypedetect group.
>
	" IN A FILE SOURCED AT STARTUP (E.G., VIMRC)

	fu! Define_colors(refresh)

		endif
	endfu

------------------------------
Explanation of Define_colors()
------------------------------
In the example, I use g:colors_name (which, if it exists, holds the name of
the currently active colorscheme) to decide which elements of the buf-local
txtfmtColor{} array need to be overridden, and what color values should be
used. It would also be possible to take 'background' into account, but be
aware that not all colorschemes set this option. You can make the color
configuration logic as simple or as complex as you like.
Note: Because Txtfmt processes each element of the txtfmtColor{} array as a
separate entity, it is necessary to set only the elements you wish to change
from the Txtfmt defaults. Of course, if one of the if/else blocks sets a
particular element, the others should set it as well, even if they do not need
to override the default. Alternatively, a block that wishes to use the default
could simply unlet! the corresponding element to ensure that the Txtfmt
default is used.

It is important to note that simply changing the buf-local version of
txtfmtColor{} has no effect on an existing Txtfmt buffer; the Txtfmt plugin
must be reloaded (i.e., "refreshed") before the color changes can take effect.
When Define_colors() is called in response to a BufRead or BufNewFile event,
the required reload happens automatically because of the subsequent
"setfiletype txtfmt". In the case of the ColorScheme event, however, there is
no such automatic reload. To ensure that the user will not need to do anything
special to see the results of changing the colorscheme, I have added the
conditional :Refresh to Define_colors(). The test of the boolean "refresh"
argument ensures that the |txtfmt-:Refresh| command will be invoked only when
the colorscheme is changing and we are within a Txtfmt buffer.

Achieving colorscheme independence		*txtfmt-hl-color-names*

Although the default txtfmtColor{} array uses hard-coded color names, this is
by no means required. An intriguing possibility, which I have implemented on
my own system, is to use color name patterns corresponding to the default Vim
highlighting groups. Under this strategy, instead of naming a particular color
"red", you might instead name it "error". Within the Define_colors() routine
outlined above, you would define the error color according to the
colorscheme-specific guibg/ctermbg definitions used for the Error highlight
group. The advantage of this strategy is that it guarantees that your
Txtfmt files will look good in any colorscheme (assuming they looked good in
the original colorscheme ;-). To facilitate creation of the required color
definitions, I created a Vim script that parses the colorscheme files in
$VIMRUNTIME/colors and extracts the desired definitions for each colorscheme
automatically. I can send a copy of this script, along with instructions for
using it, to anyone who is interested...

COLOR TERMINAL PITFALLS				*txtfmt-cterm-pitfalls*

Cterm default background 		*txtfmt-cterm-default-background*

When you define a highlighting region for a cterm without specifying the
background color with ctermbg, Vim assumes the "default" background color is
desired. The "default" background for a cterm is the default background color
of the terminal itself, unless ctermbg has been overridden in a highlight
statement for the "Normal" group: e.g., >
	:hi Normal ctermbg=15
<
In such cases, the Normal background color replaces the cterm's default
background for all subsequent highlighting. Certain colorschemes (e.g., blue,
darkblue and evening) explicitly set the Normal background color in a cterm.
Others leave it at the default for the color terminal. Ordinarily, Txtfmt can
handle either case, but the following paragraph describes an issue I have
encountered with one particular terminal, seen only when 'term' is set
incorrectly...

Incorrect 'term' setting for gnome-terminal	*txtfmt-cterm-term-issue*
						*txtfmt-gnome-terminal-issue*
The default version of gnome-terminal leaves the TERM environment variable
set to xterm, although the proper setting appears to be gnome-256color.
Unfortunately, the package containing the gnome-256color terminfo description
is not installed by default on some gnome systems. Strangely, even when the
gnome-256color terminfo description is installed, gnome-terminal won't set
TERM to use it. When Vim is started in a gnome-terminal for which TERM=xterm,
the 't_Co' termcap entry is incorrectly set to 8 instead of 256. One of the
effects of this is that outputting certain foreground colors to the cterm will
cause the default background color to revert from the value defined for the
Normal group to the terminal's default. The problem appears to be limited to
the "dark" foreground colors (0-7), which are precisely the colors used in
Txtfmt's default color map. Thus, this issue has the potential to cause
serious display problems for Txtfmt.

				*txtfmt-gnome-terminal-issue-workaround*
There are several ways to resolve this issue. The simplest is to set t_Co=256:
e.g., >
	:set t_Co=256
<
The set of t_Co could go in your vimrc, or anyplace that causes it to be
executed before Txtfmt is loaded. A better solution, in my opinion, is to
ensure that Vim's 'term' option is set to its proper value (i.e.,
gnome-256color), but this is possible only if the corresponding terminfo
description is installed on your system. If the following command... >
	:set term=gnome-256color
<
...generates an error in Vim, you must first install the terminfo description.
On Fedora Linux, the package is named "ncurses-term". (It may have a different
name in other distributions.) Once you have installed the terminfo package,
you should ensure that Vim's 'term' option is set properly. There are at least
2 possible approaches:

1. Set TERM environment variable
   Put the following in one of your shell startup scripts (e.g., .bashrc): >
   export TERM=gnome-256color
<
2. Set 'term' option in your vimrc
   e.g., >
   set term=gnome-256color
<

When "hidden" tokens are not hidden		*txtfmt-cterm-ignore-issue*

Originally, Txtfmt relied exclusively upon the "Ignore" preferred highlighting
group to hide the special formatting tokens. The Ignore group was added in Vim
5.2 to permit markup characters such as the `*' and `|' ("stars and bars")
surrounding tags in a Vim help file to be hidden. It has since come to my
attention, however, that roughly half of the colorschemes distributed with Vim
do not hide text in the Ignore group. In some cases, the contrast between
foreground and background color is minimized; in other cases, there appears to
have been no attempt at all to obscure the text.
Note: It is easy to see how your particular colorscheme treats text in the
Ignore group: simply execute... >
	:hi Ignore
If the Ignore group is defined properly, the "xxx" test pattern should be
invisible.

In some cases, the Txtfmt plugin can take the Ignore group completely out of
the equation, by defining a Txtfmt-specific concealment region that sets the
foreground color equal to the background color. This strategy always works for
the GUI. It works in a cterm if and only if the terminal background color is
known to Vim; i.e., it works when the Normal group's background color has been
set (as described in section |txtfmt-cterm-default-background|). If the Normal
group background is not set, any attempt to use "bg" as a color name in a
highlight command will generate an error: e.g., >
	:hi Tf_conceal ctermfg=bg  " ERROR if Normal ctermbg not set
<
If you are seeing the formatting tokens in your Txtfmt buffer, the plugin was
unable to set ctermfg=bg. In that case, you have several options, as described
below...

					*txtfmt-cterm-ignore-workaround*
1. Redefine the Ignore group:
   First of all, determine the foreground color that most closely matches the
   default background color of your terminal. You can do this by
   experimentation, or by looking at the Ignore group definition of a
   colorscheme that does a better job of hiding Ignore'd text. (The default
   colorscheme would be a good one to check first.) Once you have determined
   the proper color, put it into a :highlight command as follows: >
	:hi Ignore ctermfg=<bg_color>
<
   Of course, you need to ensure that the :highlight command is executed after
   the colorscheme has been sourced. There are several ways this can be
   accomplished... If your colorscheme is sourced in your vimrc, and you never
   change it after that, you could put the :highlight command in your vimrc,
   just after the :colorscheme command. If, however, you sometimes change
   colorschemes after starting Vim, you should avoid this method. Instead, you
   might try one of the following:
 
	1. Put the :highlight command into an autocommand defined for the
	   ColorScheme event: e.g., >
	   :au ColorScheme * hi Ignore ctermfg=<bg_color>
<
	   The autocommand itself could be defined in your vimrc. Note that
	   the ColorScheme event is triggered only after the colorscheme has
	   been loaded. (See |ColorScheme| in the Vim help for more
	   information.)

	2. Create an override of your colorscheme file containing the
	   following two lines: >
	   :source <your_colorscheme_file>
	   :hi Ignore ctermfg=<bg_color>
<
	   The file you create should be placed in a folder that appears
	   earlier in your 'runtimepath' than the folder containing the
	   colorscheme you are overriding.

2. Define a background color for the Normal group:
   This method ensures that Vim knows the terminal background color, which
   enables Txtfmt to define its own highlight group with ctermfg=bg. You can
   set the default background color like so... >
   :hi Normal ctermbg=<desired_color>
<
   Note: Be sure to put the :highlight command in a place where it will be
   executed before Txtfmt is loaded. Any of the methods described above for
   redefining the Ignore group could be used here as well.
   Note: The Normal background color is used for all buffers, not just the
   Txtfmt ones, so you will probably want to choose a color that is close to
   your default background color.
   Note: If you are using a gnome-terminal, read section
   |txtfmt-gnome-terminal-issue| before using this method.

3. Choose a colorscheme that does a better job of hiding the text in the
   Ignore group.
   Note: Because it is not always possible to specify a foreground text color
   that _exactly_ matches a color terminal's default background, only
   colorschemes that explicitly set the Normal background color can guarantee
   that text in the Ignore group will be hidden. However, even when the
   Normal group's background color is not defined, it should usually be
   possible to find a foreground color that comes reasonably close to matching
   the default background.


CUSTOMIZING MAPPINGS				*txtfmt-map-config*

The Txtfmt filetype plugin defines a number of mappings for various modes. By
default, Txtfmt picks consistent and intuitive key sequences for the lhs of
these mappings. It may be, however, that you already use one or more of those
key sequences for an existing map in the same mode. Even if there is no direct
conflict, it is possible that Txtfmt's default mapping would create an
ambiguity with respect to an existing mapping. (For details, see
|map-ambiguous| in the Vim help.) Finally, it may be that you simply do not
like the key sequences chosen by the plugin author. Whatever the case, Txtfmt
provides several ways to customize the map lhs. You can even specify that a
conflicting or ambiguous map should not be defined at all. All of these
customization mechanisms are discussed below...

All but one of the maps defined by the Txtfmt filetype plugin begin with
<LocalLeader>; hence, you may achieve a small amount of customization by
setting the special Vim global variable |maplocalleader| to a non-default
value.

Example: >
	let g:maplocalleader = '_'

Now, when a Txtfmt map such as <LocalLeader>I is defined, the actual {lhs}
will be _I instead of the default \I. Of course, if the conflicting map was
also defined with <LocalLeader>, then this approach will not resolve the
conflict.

A more flexible mechanism for customizing maps involves the <Plug> construct.
If you are unfamiliar with this construct, you may wish to see |using-<Plug>|
in the Vim documentation. All of the mappings provided by the Txtfmt filetype
plugin are defined in a 2 stage process, which permits the default {lhs} to be
completely redefined. To the 2 "stages" in the map definition process
correspond 2 map "levels", henceforth referred to as the 1st and 2nd levels.

The 2nd level map is the one whose {rhs} actually implements the Txtfmt
functionality. The {lhs} of the 2nd level map is a key sequence beginning with
<Plug>, which can never be produced by the keyboard alone. Thus, if the Txtfmt
map functionality is to be usable, there must be a 1st level mapping capable
of producing this untypable key sequence. If Txtfmt sees that the user has
already defined such a map, it will define only the 2nd level map, effectively
allowing the user-defined 1st level map to override the default map sequence.
If, on the other hand, the user has not defined a 1st level map for a
particular map functionality, Txtfmt will define a 1st level map with the
default key sequence listed in this help document.

Some examples using one of the "Jump to token" mappings will be used to
illustrate the concepts presented above...

From the section defining the insert token maps (|txtfmt-ins-tok-map-list|),
we see the following map definition:

    <LocalLeader>i     <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_i

The <LocalLeader>i represents the default 1st level map {lhs}, while
<Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_i is the 2nd level map {lhs}. The following 4 examples
show the 1st level map that results for 4 distinct customization scenarios.

	Scenario: Neither maplocalleader nor 1st level map redefined
	Result: \i  ==> insert token functionality

	Scenario: maplocalleader redefined as follows: >
	let maplocalleader = '_'
<	Result: _i  ==> insert token functionality

	Scenario: 1st level map redefined as follows in user's vimrc (or
	something sourced prior to Txtfmt load): >
	nmap _it <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_i
<	Result: _it ==> insert token functionality
	                (\i map not created)

	Scenario: Both maplocalleader and 1st level map redefined: >
	let maplocalleader = '_'
	nmap <LocalLeader>it <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_i
<	Result: _it ==> insert token functionality
	                (\i map not created)


Handling map conflicts and ambiguities		*txtfmt-map-conflict*

The mechanisms described above permit the Txtfmt user to eliminate map
conflicts and ambiguities once they become known. Of course, when you first
begin using the Txtfmt plugin, you will probably not be aware of the
conflicts. By default, Txtfmt will overwrite any existing mappings with its
own 1st level maps; moreover, to ensure that you have the opportunity to
resolve the conflict, Txtfmt gives one warning per Vim session for each
conflict or ambiguity it detects. The default behavior just described may be
tailored with global option |txtfmtMapwarn|. With this option, you can specify
any or all of the following:

	-whether echomsg or echoerr is used for warnings
	-whether the same map conflict/ambiguity will produce a warning every
	 time the plugin is sourced, or only once per Vim session
	-whether a Txtfmt map will be created when a conflicting/ambiguous map
	 exists

The |txtfmtMapwarn| option may be set to a string of the following character
flags: "mMeEoOcC". The flags may appear in any combination and in any order.
Lowercase flags affect the handling of map ambiguities, while uppercase flags
pertain to map conflicts. The meaning of the flags is as follows:

	m	Use :echomsg to warn about map ambiguities
	M	Use :echomsg to warn about map conflicts
	e	Use :echoerr to warn about map ambiguities
	E	Use :echoerr to warn about map conflicts
	o	Warn of a particular map ambiguity only once per Vim session 
	O	Warn of a particular map conflict only once per Vim session 
	c	Create the Txtfmt map in case of map ambiguity
	C	Create the Txtfmt map in case of map conflict

The "once-only" flag: The intent of the o and O flags is to prevent the user
from being bombarded with the same conflict warning every time he loads a
Txtfmt buffer. To determine whether a map conflict or ambiguity is identical
to one for which the user has already been warned, Txtfmt employs the concept
of a "conflict instance". A conflict instance is defined by a unique
combination of the following:

	-map mode
	-{lhs} of the Txtfmt map
	-{rhs} of the existing map

Note: If mutually exclusive flags are used, Txtfmt will give precedence to the
flag appearing later in the string. If a flag is used without another flag
required to give it meaning, the useless flag is simply ignored. Txtfmt will
not generate an error unless invalid flags are used.

==============================================================================
6. User interface				*txtfmt-user-interface*

INSERTING TOKENS				*txtfmt-ins-tok*

Whenever you wish to alter the formatting or coloring of text in a Txtfmt
buffer, you must insert the appropriate Txtfmt token or tokens. A single
format token is sufficient to determine any combination of format attributes,
just as a single color token is sufficient to determine any of the 8 possible
foreground or background colors. Thus, as a general rule, a Txtfmt buffer will
not contain sequences of more than 3 consecutive Txtfmt tokens. There are,
however, times when it makes sense to insert more than 3 Txtfmt tokens at
once; when you know, for example, that the region you are creating will be
terminated by an explicit "no format" and/or "no color" token, you may wish to
insert both the region opening and closing tokens with a single insert
mapping, which leaves the cursor positioned just after the opening tokens
where the region text will go. Details on the various mappings are provided
below in the section on |txtfmt-ins-tok-map-list|. Before you attempt to use
those mappings, however, you should be familiar with the concept of
format/color specifications. Each of the token insertion mappings prompts you
to enter a list of such specifications, which it then translates into a
sequence of tokens to be inserted into the buffer. The following sections
describe these specifications and the lists comprising them in detail.

Fmt spec					*txtfmt-fmt-spec*

A format specification specifies a unique combination of valid format
attributes. The set of "valid" format attributes is determined by the
|txtfmt-'tokrange'| option (in particular, by the tokrange suffix) as well as
by the version of Vim you are using.

The format of a single format specification is given as follows:

    f{fmts}

where {fmts} is a string consisting of either a single dash ('-') indicating
"no format attributes", or a sequence of letters from the set "ubisrc", in
which each letter represents a format attribute that should be applied to the
region. The letter/attribute correspondences are shown in the table below.
Also shown are the |txtfmt-'tokrange'| suffix and version of Vim required to
enable the format attribute.

    ====================================================
    | ltr | attribute         |  tokrange  | v:version |
    |     |                   |   suffix   |           |
    ====================================================
    |  u  | underline         |   S or X   |    any    |
    |  b  | bold              |   S or X   |    any    |
    |  i  | italic            |   S or X   |    any    |
    |  s  | standout          |     L      |    any    |
    |  r  | reverse (inverse) |     L      |    any    |
    |  c  | undercurl         |     L      |   >= 700  |
    ====================================================

    Note: {fmts} may contain any combination of valid format specification
    letters in any order.

Clr spec					*txtfmt-clr-spec*

A color specification specifies a single color from among up to 8
possibilities in the active color definition.

The format of a single color specification is given as follows:

    {typ}{clr}

{typ} is either
	'c' => foreground color
	'k' => background color
{clr} is either a single dash ('-') indicating "no color" (i.e., default
color), or a string matching the {namepat} corresponding to one of the 8
possible colors. As discussed in the section |txtfmt-color-config|, {namepat}
is simply a Vim regular expression used to recognize a (possibly abbreviated)
color name. The default color definitions use Vim's \%[] contruct with
intuitive color names (e.g.  "red", "green", "blue") so that you can usually
specify a color by the first letter of its name.

Example: >
	{namepat}     valid {clr} values
	===================================
	b\%[lue]$     "b" "bl" "blu" "blue"
	r\%[ed]$      "r" "re" "red"

Of course, if you override the default color definition array, you are free to
define whatever colors and corresponding {namepat}'s you like. See
|txtfmt-color-config| for details.


Fmt/clr spec list				*txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list*

Since most mappings and functions for working with fmt/clr tokens permit
multiple tokens to be inserted simultaneously, Txtfmt permits the format/color
specifications described in the preceding two sections to be concatenated into
comma or dot-separated lists. The resulting "format/color specification lists"
are the topic of this section.

Format/color specification lists may contain any number of fmt-spec and
clr-spec "atoms", freely intermixed and in any order. Internally, Txtfmt will
translate the list of fmt/clr atoms into a sequence of character codes
representing the corresponding fmt/clr tokens. By default, Txtfmt's token
insertion mappings leave the cursor after the final token inserted; you can
alter this behavior, however, by replacing one of the commas separating the
individual fmt/clr specs with a dot ('.') to indicate the desired cursor
position.
Note: Although commas are used only to separate items in the list, a dot may
be placed at the beginning of the list to indicate that the cursor should end
up before any of the inserted tokens.

Here are a few example fmt/clr spec lists:
	Note: The following examples assume the default color definitions
        listed in |txtfmt-color-defaults|.

	kb
	Result: Blue background region is begun (but not terminated). Cursor
	is positioned after the inserted token.

	fu,cr
	Result: Red underline region is begun (but not terminated). Cursor is
	positioned after the inserted tokens.

	fbi,cg,kr.k-,c-,f-	       
	Result: Green bold,italic on red background region is begun (and
	simultaneously terminated). Cursor is left just inside the region.

	.f-,c-
	Result: Inserts the "no format" and "no color" tokens, but leaves
	cursor positioned within the combined fmt/clr region being terminated.

	fubisrc
	Result: Underline,bold,italic,standout,reverse,undercurl region is
	begun. Cursor is positioned after the inserted token.

Mapping overview				*txtfmt-ins-tok-maps*

The Txtfmt filetype plugin provides a number of mappings that may be used to
insert the special tokens used to delineate the Txtfmt format/color regions.
All of the token insertion mappings prompt the user to enter a special comma
or dot-separated list, known as a fmt/clr spec list, which completely
describes the sequence of tokens that should be inserted. Details on the
format of this list may be found in section |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list|.

There are actually 15 separate mappings that may be used to insert Txtfmt
tokens: 1 may be used only in insert mode; the other 14 are used only in
normal mode. The main reason there are so many normal mode mappings is that
Vim provides many ways to go from normal mode to insert mode, each of which
may be more suitable than the others in a given context. Suppose, for example,
that you are in normal mode and you wish to insert the "no format" token at
the end of the current line. You might consider jumping to the end of the line
with $, then invoking a Txtfmt normal mode mapping to insert the token. If,
for the sake of example, Txtfmt provided only one normal mode mapping, which
inserted tokens before the cursor position, you would have a problem. The
token would be inserted prior to the last character on the line, when in fact,
it needed to go after the last character on the line. In this case, you could
circumvent the difficulty by hitting A in normal mode (instead of $) and using
the Txtfmt insert mode mapping to insert the desired token, but this would
require separate operations for entering and exiting insert mode. What would
be preferable here is a Txtfmt normal mode mapping that functions in a manner
analogous to Vim's normal mode 'A' command for entering insert mode.

Of course, we could construct other examples, which call for mappings that
insert tokens at the beginning of a line (analogous to Vim's normal mode 'I'
command), or mappings that replace the N characters under the cursor with the
tokens inserted (analogous to Vim's normal mode 's' command), and so on... By
the same token, there may be times when you wish to remain in insert mode
after the tokens have been inserted, and times when you wish simply to insert
the tokens and return to normal mode. The Txtfmt insert-token mappings listed
below provide you with all of those capabilities and more.

Although the number of normal mode mappings may appear large at first glance,
their default key sequences are intuitive, once you understand that they all
are constructed according to the following pattern:

	<LocalLeader>[{end-in-normal}]{vim-enterinsert-char}

where {vim-enterinsert-char} is one of Vim's single-letter normal mode
commands for entering insert mode: >
	i, I, a, A, o, O, s
and the optional {end-in-normal} is the letter 'v', which is simply a flag
indicating that you wish to return to normal mode after the insertion.

There is only one insert mode mapping. Its default map sequence was selected
because it is (in the author's opinion, at least) fairly easy to type, and not
something you are otherwise likely to type in insert mode.

All 15 of the insert-token mappings are listed below, with similar ones
grouped together to avoid repetition. For each mapping, 2 forms are shown:
	1. The default map sequence
	2. The <Plug> form, used only for customization
For details on customizing maps, refer to section |txtfmt-map-config|.

Mapping list					*txtfmt-ins-tok-map-list*

<LocalLeader>i	   <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_i	*\i* *txtfmt-ins-tok-i*
<LocalLeader>I	   <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_I	*\I* *txtfmt-ins-tok-I*
<LocalLeader>a	   <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_a	*\a* *txtfmt-ins-tok-a*
<LocalLeader>A	   <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_A	*\A* *txtfmt-ins-tok-A*
<LocalLeader>o	   <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_o	*\o* *txtfmt-ins-tok-o*
<LocalLeader>O	   <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_O	*\O* *txtfmt-ins-tok-O*
<LocalLeader>s	   <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_s	*\s* *txtfmt-ins-tok-s*

Available in normal mode only. Insert a sequence of Txtfmt tokens in the
current buffer and remain in insert mode. The various mappings differ only in
how they enter insert mode. Conceptually, they all do the following:

	-Prompt user to enter a |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list| at the command line
	-Translate the entered text into a Txtfmt token sequence
	-Enter insert mode via the {vim-enterinsert-char} specified in the
	 default map sequence.
	-Insert the token sequence (with <C-R><C-R>=)
	-Perform any cursor adjustment requested by the presence of a dot
	 ('.') in the |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list|.
	-Remain in insert mode.

<LocalLeader>vi    <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_vi	*\vi* *txtfmt-ins-tok-vi*
<LocalLeader>vI    <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_vI	*\vI* *txtfmt-ins-tok-vI*
<LocalLeader>va    <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_va	*\va* *txtfmt-ins-tok-va*
<LocalLeader>vA    <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_vA	*\vA* *txtfmt-ins-tok-vA*
<LocalLeader>vo    <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_vo	*\vo* *txtfmt-ins-tok-vo*
<LocalLeader>vO    <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_vO	*\vO* *txtfmt-ins-tok-vO*
<LocalLeader>vs    <Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_vs	*\vs* *txtfmt-ins-tok-vs*

Available in normal mode only. Insert a sequence of Txtfmt tokens in the
current buffer and return to normal mode. The various mappings differ only in
how they enter insert mode. Conceptually, they all do the following:

	-Prompt user to enter a |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list| at the command line
	-Translate the entered text into a Txtfmt token sequence
	-Enter insert mode via the {vim-enterinsert-char} specified in the
	 default map sequence.
	-Insert the token sequence (with <C-R><C-R>=)
	-Perform any cursor adjustment requested by the presence of a dot
	 ('.') in the |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list|.
	-Exit insert mode.

						*<C-\><C-\>*
<C-\><C-\>	<Plug>TxtfmtInsertTok_i		*txtfmt-ins-tok-CTRL-\_CTRL-\*

Available in insert mode only. Insert a sequence of Txtfmt tokens in the
current buffer and remain in insert mode. The mapping works like this:

	-Prompt user to enter a |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list| at the command line
	-Translate the entered text into a Txtfmt token sequence
	-Insert the token sequence (with <C-R><C-R>=)
	-Perform any cursor adjustment requested by the presence of a dot
	('.') in the |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list|.
	-Remain in insert mode.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Txtfmt will generate an error if |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list|
specifies any colors that are inactive under the effective color masks. See
|txtfmtFgcolormask| or |txtfmtBgcolormask| for details on configuring color
masks.

JUMPING TO TOKENS				*txtfmt-jump-to-tok*

The Txtfmt syntax plugin conceals the special tokens delineating the
format/color regions. Normally, you will see such tokens only in 3 cases:
	1. when a region containing them is visually selected
	2. when the token is serving no purpose in the buffer
	   Rationale: When a default ("no format" or "no color") token,
	   normally used to terminate a region, appears where there is no
	   region to terminate, Txtfmt intentionally leaves the token visible
	   so that you might notice and remove it.
	3. when a fg or bg color token is disabled by |txtfmtFgcolormask| or
	  |txtfmtBgcolormask|

Although this behavior is generally what you want, it can make it difficult to
locate tokens after you have inserted them. There are many reasons why you
might wish to locate a concealed token: to remove it, to change it to a
different token, to insert another token immediately before or after it,
etc... To simplify the task of locating such tokens, Txtfmt provides various
mappings for jumping to them. These "jump to token" commands are analogous to
various Vim motion commands: e.g., [{, ]}, f, F, t, T, etc...

There are exactly 48 such mappings, but their default map sequences are
constructed according to a pattern, which renders memorization of the
individual mappings unnecessary. (The desired mapping can be easily deduced
according to the pattern.)

	{direction}[{till-flag}][{target-modifier}]{target}

The definitions of the fields in the pattern given above are as follows:
	{direction}
		[ (search backwards)
		] (search forwards)
	{till-flag}
		Optional flag consisting of the letter 't'. If present,
		indicates that the sought position is 1 character position
		closer to the starting point of the jump than it would have
		been without the {till-flag}. Behavior is analogous to that of
		Vim's normal mode T operator; i.e., jump is "till" the target
		location.
	{target-modifier}
		b (begin region tokens)
		e (end region tokens)
		Note: While there are a number of tokens that can begin a
		format or color region, each of the 3 orthogonal region types
		has only one "end region" token: the one specified by a dash
		(`-') in the |txtfmt-fmt-spec| or |txtfmt-clr-spec|.
	{target}
		f (format tokens)
		c (fg color tokens)
		k (bg color tokens)
		a (any format or fg/bg color token)

	Examples: >
		]f      Jump forward to next token that begins or ends a
		        format region
		]ef     Jump forward to next "end format region" token
		[tbc    Jump backward "till" previous "begin fg color region"
		        token


All of the jump-to-token mappings are defined for normal, visual, and
operator-pending modes, and all can take a count, which causes them to jump to
the [count] token of the specified type in the specified direction. Whether
the search for tokens wraps around the start or end of the buffer is
determined by the 'wrapscan' option.

SPECIAL NOTE ON VISUAL MODE
    The visual-mode maps correctly extend the visual selection for linewise,
    characterwise and blockwise selections.

SPECIAL NOTE ON OPERATOR-PENDING MODE
    By default, when used with an operator such as 'd', 'c' or 'y', a
    jump-to-token map behaves in an "exclusive" manner; i.e., the character
    landed upon is not deleted, changed or yanked. If you wish to make these
    motions work more like the builtin 'f', 't', 'F' and 'T' commands, simply
    hit 'v' between the operator and the jump-to-token map. (For details, see
    |o_v| in the Vim help.)

All 48 of the jump-to-token mappings are listed below. For each mapping, 2
forms are shown:
	1. The default map sequence
	2. The <Plug> form, used only for customization
For details on customizing maps, refer to section |txtfmt-map-config|.

BUILDING COMPLEX MAPPINGS FROM PRIMITIVES	*txtfmt-user-maps*

The insert-token maps discussed in a preceding section permit the insertion of
a single sequence of fmt/clr tokens at a fixed location relative to the cursor
position. A common scenario, however, is one in which you wish to perform
multiple insertions, possibly interspersed with cursor movements and other Vim
commands. Suppose, for example, that you often find yourself highlighting an
entire line in bold,italic, and then using :ce to center the text on the line.
You could accomplish this using only Vim commands and insert-token maps as
follows: >

	Hit \vI and enter fmt spec "fbi" at the prompt
	Hit \vA and enter fmt spec "f-" at the prompt
	Execute :ce[nter] at the command-line

While this approach works, it could become tedious if you do it often. A
better approach would be to create a single mapping that executes the entire
sequence of steps shown above. To facilitate creation of such maps, Txtfmt
provides a mechanism known as "user-maps". User-map creation is requested
through the "old-style" Vim array |txtfmtUsermap{}|. The first element of the
array is txtfmtUsermap{1} and the last element is txtfmtUsermap{N}, where N is
determined from option variable |txtfmtUsermaplimit|. It is not necessary to
set every element between indices 1 and N. You may define as many or as few
maps within that range as you like. Only the elements that have been set will
cause a map to be created. Moreover, both |txtfmtUsermap{}| and
|txtfmtUsermaplimit| may be set either globally or buffer-locally. As a
general rule, the global elements define mappings that should be available in
any type of file, whereas buffer-local elements would define more specialized
maps: e.g. maps that are used only when using Txtfmt within C comments in
buffers whose filetype is set to "c.txtfmt". For a more detailed look at
possible usage scenarios involving buf-local assignment to |txtfmtUsermap{}|
elements, see |txtfmt-buflocal-user-map|.

txtfmtUsermap{} element format			*txtfmt-user-map-fmt*

Each element of the |txtfmtUsermap{}| array is a string, which specifies a
single normal or insert mode map to be created in the Txtfmt buffer. The
format of the string is as follows:

	"{map-cmd} {map-lhs} {map-rhs}"

The descriptions of the fields in braces are as follows:

    {map-cmd}
	The map creation command used by Txtfmt to create the mapping.
	Currently, the following commands are supported:
	    imap, inoremap, nmap, nnoremap
    {map-lhs}
	Everything following {map-cmd} up to the first whitespace character
	that is not preceded by a literal CTRL-V represents the {lhs} of the
	mapping to be created.
    {map-rhs}
	The remainder of the string represents the {rhs} of the mapping to be
	created. May contain special user-map expansion macros within <<...>>
	requesting Txtfmt "insert-token" or "jump-to-token" functionality.
	(See section |txtfmt-user-map-expansion| below.)

MAP-LHS DETAILS
Note that {map-lhs} should appear exactly as it would if the mapping were
being created without the aid of Txtfmt; i.e., just as it would if you were
creating the map with an :exe[cute] on the |txtfmtUsermap{}| string. This
means, for example, that whitespace may be included in the {lhs} if it is
escaped by a literal CTRL-V, and that the special key notation sequences (e.g.
<Up>, <Down>, <Bslash>, etc...) may be used in place of the corresponding key
codes. For more details, read the following sections in the Vim documentation:
	|:map-special-keys|
	|:map-special-chars|

MAP-RHS DETAILS
Vim's normal map processing rules apply to {map-rhs} as well; however, Txtfmt
performs a special pre-processing step on {map-rhs} before it is used to
define the map; in particular, it scans for and processes the special Txtfmt
expansion macros (enclosed in <<...>>), which are the subject of the following
section. To include a literal `<' in {map-rhs}, use the special <lt> notation
discussed in the Vim help for commands and mappings and documented in the
|key-notation| table.

Example: >
	<lt><lt>EOF
	produces a mapping that looks like
	<<EOF

Note: If necessary, you may use the special symbol <rt> to get a literal `>'
into {map-rhs}. The <rt> symbol is special only within a Txtfmt user-map
expansion macro. (Although it is unlikely you would ever need to include a
literal `>>' within an expansion macro, use of non-alphanumeric characters as
part of a color name is currently not prohibited.)

Example: >
	<<n\i:cstrange<rt><rt>color<rt><rt>name>>
	inserts token for fg color whose user-defined pattern matches
	"strange>>color>>name"

User-map expansion macros			*txtfmt-user-map-expansion*

When Txtfmt encounters `<<' in {map-rhs}, it attempts to process a user-map
expansion macro. To facilitate the addition of user-map macros in future
versions of txtfmt, the following template has been devised:

	<<{mode}{cmd}[{cmd-modifiers}][:{cmd-parameters}]>>

The descriptions of the fields in braces are as follows:

	{mode}			Single character representing the expected
				mode at the instant the `<<' is encountered.
				    i = insert
				    n = normal
				    o = operator-pending
				    v = visual
				Note: The mode flag may specify a mode
				different from the mode indicated by {map-cmd}
				(discussed in the previous section). Consider
				that a single normal or insert mode mapping
				may cause multiple modes to be entered and
				exited as the rhs of the mapping is traversed.
				This flag specifies the "instantaneous" mode.
	[{count}]		Optional count to be applied to {cmd}.
				Note: Not all expansion macros accept a count.
				See command-specific documentation below to
				determine which ones do.
	{cmd}			A character or characters indicating the
				Txtfmt functionality that is required.
				Currently, all {cmd}'s are indicated by a
				special character, which, in most cases,
				corresponds to the first character of the
				associated default map:
				\		Insert-token
				`[' or `]'	Jump-to-token
	[{cmd-modifiers}]	Optional data modifying the behavior of the
				{cmd} in some way. (See command-specific
				documentation below.)
	[{cmd-parameters}]	Permits data that would normally be entered at
				a prompt at the time of map execution to be
				specified in advance (i.e. at the time of map
				creation).

The specific forms of user-map macro are shown below, grouped according to the
Txtfmt functionality involved.

INSERT TOKEN MACROS
    <<i\:{fmt-clr-spec-list}>>
    <<n[{count}]\[{end-in-normal}]{vim-enterinsert-char}:{fmt-clr-spec-list}>>

Both forms of "insert-token" macro contain a |fmt-clr-spec-list|, describing
the sequence of fmt/clr tokens to be inserted and optionally specifying a
cursor offset with a single dot somewhere in the otherwise comma-separated
list. The first form is used when the instantaneous mode within {map-rhs} is
"insert", whereas the more complicated second form is needed when the
instantaneous mode is "normal". (See earlier description of {mode} flag.)

There are 3 additional parameters that apply only to the normal mode form of
the insert-token expansion sequence:

    {count} is an optional value, specifying the count to be applied to the
    enter-insert command. Specifying a count in this manner is analogous to
    typing a count prior to executing the corresponding insert-token map in
    normal mode.

    {vim-enterinsert-char} is one of Vim's single-letter normal mode commands
    for entering insert mode: >
	i, I, a, A, o, O, s
<   Proper choice of enter-insert command can simplify the mapping by
    minimizing the number of movement commands required to position the cursor
    prior to token insertion.

    {end-in-normal} is the letter 'v', which, when present, serves as a flag
    indicating that you wish to return to normal mode after the insertion. The
    flag is provided as a convenience to minimize the number of "<Esc>"
    characters that need to be embedded in {map-rhs}.

Examples: >
	<<i\:c->>	Starting in insert mode, insert "no fg color" token at
			cursor location.
	<<n\I:fbi>>	Starting in normal mode, insert "bold,italic" token at
			beginning of line. Ends in insert mode.
	<<n5\vs:fu>>	Starting in normal mode, 'substitute' the next 5
			characters with a single "underline" token. Ends in
			normal mode.

JUMP TO TOKEN MACROS

    <<{mode}[{count}]{default-jump-to-tok-map}>>

A jump-to-token macro is created simply by prepending the {mode} flag and the
optional {count} to the default mapping representing the desired jump, and
enclosing the whole string within `<<' and `>>'. For a detailed discussion of
the various forms of jump-to-token mappings and a listing of the default
mappings, see |txtfmt-jump-to-tok| and |txtfmt-jump-to-tok-maps|.

Examples: >
	<<n]k>>		Jump forward to next bg color region token
	<<n[ec>>	Jump backward to previous "end fg color region" token
	<<n3]tbf>>	Jump forward "till" 3rd "begin format region" token

User-map examples				*txtfmt-user-map-examples*

The following concrete examples should help to clarify the use of the various
forms of user-map expansion sequence. You should be able to copy any that
appear useful to your .vimrc.


	" Map CTRL-B in insert mode to start and terminate a 'bold' region,
	" leaving the cursor positioned within the region, ready to type bold
	" text.
	" Hint: Similar maps might be created for underline and italic >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap1 = 'inoremap <C-B> <<i\:fb.f->>'
<
	" Map CTRL-\f in insert mode to end current format region. >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap2 = 'inoremap <C-\>f <<i\:f->>'
<
	" Map CTRL-\k in insert mode to end current bg color region. >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap3 = 'inoremap <C-\>k <<i\:k->>'
<
	" Map \t in normal mode to embolden, underline and center (i.e.
	" 'title-ize') the current line >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap4 =
	    \'nnoremap <Bslash>t <<n\vI:fbu>><<n\vA:f->>:ce<CR>'
<
	" Map \cf in normal mode to change all text within the current format
	" region (without deleting the tokens that begin and end the region).
	" Note: Since the default jump-to-token mappings are used in the rhs
	" (rather than the special expansion macros), nmap must be used (rather
	" than nnoremap).
	" Note: The reason the ]f does not cause the format 'end region' token to
	" be deleted is that the operator-pending jump-to-token maps work
	" 'exclusive-ly' when there is no 'v' between operator and motion.
	"     :help exclusive >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap5 = 'nmap <Bslash>cf [tbfc]f'
<
	" Same as preceding map but for current fg color region.
	" Note: This one demonstrates the use of the 'jump-to-token' expansion
	" macros. >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap6 = 'nnoremap <Bslash>cc <<n[tbc>>c<<o]c>>'
<
	" Map <LocalLeader>bw in normal mode to embolden the word under the
	" cursor. (The extra complexity is needed to ensure that you can invoke
	" with cursor anywhere on the word.) >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap7 =
	    \'nnoremap <LocalLeader>bw :if col(".")!=1 && '
	    \.'getline(".")[col(".")-2]=~"\\w"<Bar>exe "norm!  b"<Bar>'
	    \.'endif<CR><<n\vi:fb>>e<<n\va:f->>b'
<
	" Map \vf in normal mode to select all of the current format region
	" visually.
	" Note: Unlike the earlier one for changing the text in the current
	" format region, this one doesn't constrain the backwards jump to a
	" 'begin region' token; hence, it will also highlight the text between
	" regions if the cursor lies between regions at the time the map is
	" invoked. >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap8 = 'nnoremap <LocalLeader>vf <<n[tf>>v<<v]tf>>'
<
	" Map <C-\>vf in insert mode to do the same in insert mode >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap9 = 'inoremap <C-\>vf <<i[tf>><Esc>lv<<v]tf>>'
<
	" Map <LocalLeader><Space> in normal mode to jump forward to the 3rd
	" 'begin format region' token. (Not overly practical, but demonstrates the

	let g:txtfmtUsermap10 = 'nnoremap <LocalLeader><Space> <<n3]bf>>'
<
	" Map <LocalLeader>_ in normal mode to substitute the next 4 characters
	" with a bold format token followed by a 'no format' token, leaving the

	" specification of a count with an insert-token expansion macro.) >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap11 = 'nnoremap <LocalLeader>_ <<n4\s:fb.f->>'
<
	" Map <LocalLeader>rb in normal mode to make the current line bold with a

	let g:txtfmtUsermap12 =
	    \'nnoremap <LocalLeader>rb <<n\vI:kr,fb>><<n\vA:f-,k->>'
<

Using buf-local sets				*txtfmt-buflocal-user-map*

As mentioned in an earlier section, both txtfmtUsermap{} and
txtfmtUsermaplimit may be set either globally or buf-locally. Here's how it
works... When Txtfmt loads, it determines the effective value of
txtfmtUsermaplimit according to the following logic: >
	if exists('b:txtfmtUsermaplimit')
		let txtfmtUsermaplimit = b:txtfmtUsermaplimit
	elseif exists('g:txtfmtUsermaplimit')
		let txtfmtUsermaplimit = g:txtfmtUsermaplimit
	else
		let txtfmtUsermaplimit = 25 "use default
	endif

Txtfmt then executes the following (pseudo-code) loop: >
	for i = 1, txtfmtUsermaplimit
		if exists('b:txtfmtUsermap{i}')
			Define user-map b:txtfmtUsermap{i}
		elseif exists('g:txtfmtUsermap{i}')
			Define user-map g:txtfmtUsermap{i}
		endif
	endloop

Several points to note:
    -Leaving elements of txtfmtUsermap{} undefined is harmless.
    -Setting b:txtfmtUsermaplimit effectively overrides any existing setting
     of g:txtfmtUsermaplimit.
    -Setting an element of b:txtfmtUsermap{} effectively hides the
     corresponding element of g:txtfmtUsermap{}.

You may be wondering why you would ever need to use the buffer-local versions
of txtfmtUsermap{} and txtfmtUsermaplimit. If you edit only one type of file
with Txtfmt, then the simplest approach would be to use only the global
versions. It is possible, however, that while you have some user-maps that are
generally useful, you also have some special-purpose user-maps, which are
useful only in a certain type of file. Defining such user-maps globally would
render the corresponding {map-lhs} unusable in files in which you would never
need the special-purpose user-map. I will now describe a strategy that uses
the buf-local user-map option variables to circumvent the problem just
described...

STEP #1
=======
In your .vimrc, define user-maps 1..N using g:txtfmtUsermap{} and set the
global version of txtfmtUsermaplimit to N.
Note: All of the maps defined in this manner should be general purpose maps,
which you might need in any Txtfmt buffer.

Example: >
	let g:txtfmtUsermap1 = '<generally useful map #1>'
	let g:txtfmtUsermap2 = '<generally useful map #2>'
	.
	.
	let g:txtfmtUsermapN = '<generally useful map #N>'
	let g:txtfmtUsermaplimit = N

STEP #2
=======
Create global functions that define special-purpose user maps N+1..M using the
buffer-local versions of txtfmtUsermap{} and set the buffer-local version of
txtfmtUsermaplimit to N+M.
Note: Since these functions do not overwrite previously set elements of the
g:txtfmtUsermap{}, the general-purpose user-maps will be left intact.

Example: >
	" This function defines special-purpose Txtfmt user-maps, useful only
	" for *.abc files.
	fu! Define_txtfmt_abc_usermaps()
		let N = g:txtfmtUsermaplimit
		let b:txtfmtUsermap{N+1} = '<special-purpose map #1>'
		let b:txtfmtUsermap{N+2} = '<special-purpose map #2>'
		.
		.
		let b:txtfmtUsermap{N+M} = '<special-purpose map #M>'
		" Ensure that both the general-purpose and special-purpose
		" user-maps are defined.
		let b:txtfmtUsermaplimit = N+M
	endfu

STEP #3
=======
Ensure that each special-purpose map function is called from an autocommand
specific to the filetype that will need the user-maps it defines.

Note: It is necessary to define these autocommands prior to the ones that set
filetype to txtfmt, so that the changes to txtfmtUsermap{} occur before Txtfmt
is loaded. An easy way to ensure the proper sequence is to place the
autocommands that call the map definition functions within the same
autocommand group as the setfiletype autocommand (see example below).

Example: >
	" Inside ~/.vim/filetype.vim
	augroup filetypedetect
	    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.abc    call Define_txtfmt_abc_usermaps()
	    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.xyz    call Define_txtfmt_xyz_usermaps()
	    .
	    .
	    " Set up detection for Txtfmt files
	    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.abc    setfiletype txtfmt
	    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.xyz    setfiletype txtfmt
	    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt    setfiletype txtfmt
	augroup END

It should be noted that the strategy outlined above is simply one of many
possibilities. A slight variation would be to replace the general-purpose
user-maps altogether with special-purpose ones for one or more filetypes.
Suppose, for example, that we knew we would use only special-purpose maps when
editing a '*.abc' file. In that case, we would simply omit all occurrences of
"N+" in Define_txtfmt_abc_usermaps() to ensure that the general-purpose maps
were overridden.

CREATING TOKEN STRINGS				*txtfmt-create-tok-str*
Txtfmt_GetTokStr({fmt-clr-spec-list})		*txtfmt-GetTokStr()*
	This function accepts a |txtfmt-fmt-clr-spec-list| as input and
	returns the corresponding sequence of Txtfmt tokens as a string.
	Note: May be called only from a Txtfmt buffer.

QUERYING TOKEN TYPE				*txtfmt-query-tok-type*

In most cases, the role played by a Txtfmt token will be evident from the
highlighting of the text that follows it. There are at least two scenarios,
however, in which the role played by a particular format or color token may
not be evident: 1) there is no text following the token; 2) adjacent format
and color tokens make it difficult to tell which is which, since the
formatting of the subsequent text does not depend upon the order of the
tokens. Although you can always look up the character code (obtained from
Vim's ga command) in the output of the |txtfmt-:ShowTokenMap| command, this
section presents some more convenient methods of determining a token's type...

Token-descriptors 				*txtfmt-tok-descriptor*

A {token-descriptor} is returned or displayed by all of the mappings, commands
and functions discussed in this section. A {token-descriptor} is simply a
string providing information about a particular character or token in a Txtfmt
buffer. Its format depends upon how the character is used in the buffer. The
possibilities are described below...

    format token
	A |txtfmt-fmt-spec| in fiducial form (e.g. "fubi")
    color token
	A string of the form {type}{colornum}[ (inactive)], where {type}
	indicates the type of color token ('c' => fg, 'k' => bg), {colornum}
	is a value between 1 and 8 indicating the color's index, and the
	optional " (inactive)" label, if present, indicates that the color is
	disabled by the current color mask. (For details on color masks, see
	|txtfmtFgcolormask| or |txtfmtBgcolormask|.)
    non-Txtfmt char
	A character code value in decimal format (e.g. 'a' => 97)
    invalid char position
	"NUL" (just like Vim's ga command)

						*\ga* 	*txtfmt-get-tok-info*
<LocalLeader>ga    <Plug>TxtfmtGetTokInfo
	This mapping echoes the {token-descriptor} (discussed above) of the
	character under the cursor. Analogous to Vim's builtin ga command, it
	provides the most convenient way to obtain information about the token
	under the cursor. The primary difference between it and the builtin
	version is that the Txtfmt version is aware of the special role played
	by Txtfmt formatting tokens.
	
	Note: The <Plug> form of the mapping may be used for customization.
	For details on customizing maps, refer to section |txtfmt-map-config|.

						*txtfmt-:GetTokInfo*
:GetTokInfo [ {line} {col} ]
	This buffer-local command echoes the {token-descriptor} corresponding
	to the character/token at the requested {line} and {col} in the
	current buffer. If {line} and {col} are not supplied, the cursor
	location is assumed; i.e., calling :GetTokInfo without args is
	equivalent to executing the \ga mapping.
	Note: If either {line} or {col} is specified, both must be specified.
	Note: {col} is a 1-based byte index, such as would be returned by
	Vim's col() function. Note that this index may differ from both the
	virtual column index and the character index.

						*txtfmt-GetTokInfo()*
Txtfmt_GetTokInfo([{line}, {char}])
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	<<< DEPRECATED >>>
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	IMPORTANT NOTE: I have marked this function as deprecated because both
	the mapping and command (discussed above) provide similar
	functionality and are easier to use; however, on the off-chance that
	someone created a mapping to this function in one of the initial
	versions of Txtfmt, I have not yet removed it. Note that the 2nd
	argument to this function is a character index, which is fundamentally
	different from the byte index provided to the :GetTokInfo command. As
	a general rule, supplying byte indices, (which may be obtained with
	Vim's col() function), is easier for the plugin user.

	This function returns a string describing the token specified by
	{line} and {char}. Note that both {line} and {char} are optional.
	Either both or neither should be specified. If neither is specified,
	the returned information will apply to the character under the cursor.
	Otherwise, {char} is the 1-based index of a token on the line
	specified by {line}.
	Important Note: Because {char} is a character index, its value may
	differ from the values returned by virtcol() (screen column index) and
	col() (byte index).
	The format of the return string depends upon the type of token
	being queried, and is described above under |txtfmt-tok-descriptor|.


VIEWING TOKEN MAP				*txtfmt-view-tok-map*
						*txtfmt-:ShowTokenMap*
:ShowTokenMap
	This buffer-local command echoes a table displaying the current
	format/color token map in an intuitive and informative manner.
	Note: Since a Txtfmt token map is specific to a buffer, the command
	may be used only from a Txtfmt buffer. The table columns are slightly
	different for formats and colors. Here is some sample output text,
	which corresponds to the default |txtfmt-'tokrange'| setting...

	 === FG COLORS ===
	 char-nr  description            clr-pattern          clr-def  
	 0xE000   no color               -                    N.A.     
	 0xE001   Color1                 ^\%(k\|bla\%[ck]\)$  #000000  
	 0xE002   Color2                 ^b\%[lue]$           #0000FF  
	 .
	 .
	 0xE008   Color8                 ^w\%[hite]$          #FFFFFF  
	 === FORMAT ===
	 char-nr  description            fmt-spec             
	 0xE009   no format              -                    
	 0xE00A   underline              u                    
	 .
	 .
	 0xE010   underline,bold,italic  ibu                  
	 === BG COLORS ===
	 char-nr  description            clr-pattern          clr-def  
	 0xE011   no color               -                    N.A.     
	*0xE012   Color1 (inactive)      ^\%(k\|bla\%[ck]\)$  #000000  
	 0xE013   Color2                 ^b\%[lue]$           #0000FF  
	 .
	 .
	*0xE019   Color8 (inactive)      ^w\%[hite]$          #FFFFFF  

	Several points to note:

	The fmt-spec column gives the set of characters (in fiducial form)
	that you would put after the 'f' in a |txtfmt-fmt-spec| to insert the
	corresponding format token.
	Note: The order of the characters in the set is not significant; i.e.,
	"ubi" is equivalent to "ibu" and "bui".

	The clr-pattern column represents the Vim regular expression that is
	used to recognize a color name in a |txtfmt-clr-spec|.

	The clr-def column under the "COLORS" section represents the actual
	color definitions supplied to Vim via the :highlight command: e.g.
		hi guifg={clr-def}
		hi ctermfg={clr-def}
	For GUI'S, the {clr-def} is either a symbolic color name (e.g.,
	DarkBlue) or a literal RGB value (e.g., #FF0000). For cterm's, it
	could be a color number or a symbolic color name.
	Note: All of the values in the final 2 columns of the "FG/BG COLORS"
	sections may be overridden by the user. For details, see
	|txtfmt-color-config|.

	The presence of an asterisk before the char-nr and the string
	"(inactive)" following the color description indicates that a color
	has been rendered inactive by the fg or bg colormask currently in
	effect. For details, see |txtfmtFgcolormask|.

	The char-nr column displays the character code value in the number
	format used to set |txtfmt-'tokrange'|.


TESTING CURRENT SETTINGS			*txtfmt-test-cur-settings*
						*txtfmt-:MakeTestPage*
:MakeTestPage [{modeline}]
	This buffer-local command creates a scratch buffer containing a
	Txtfmt "test page". The Txtfmt options used to create the test page
	take into account any global option settings, as well as any
	|txtfmt-modeline| settings specified on the command line as arguments
	to the command. Example: >

		:MakeTestPage tokrange=180S escape=bslash nested
<
	This creates a test page with the |txtfmt-'tokrange'| option set to
	"180S", the |txtfmt-'escape'| option set to "bslash" and the
	|txtfmt-'nested'| option turned on. All other Txtfmt options will have
	the values set globally, or default values if the global option has
	not been set.
	Note: Since the test page is created in a new scratch buffer,
	buffer-local option settings are not considered.

	This command provides a quick and easy way to visualize the effects of
	a particular combination of option values. Suppose, for example, that
	the default 'tokrange' option setting yields Txtfmt tokens that cannot
	be concealed by Vim, due to their use as control sequences by a
	particular terminal. In this case, you might wish to run :MakeTestPage
	iteratively, each time supplying a different value for 'tokrange',
	until you find one that appears to work.

	In addition to displaying all available formats and colors (both
	foreground and background if applicable), the test page attempts to
	show how things like token escaping and nesting of Txtfmt regions
	within non-Txtfmt regions will (or won't) work, given the applicable
	option settings. The text in the test page buffer is rather verbose,
	and is intended as an aid to the new user. Although the primary
	purpose of the test page is to provide information, the buffer created
	is a fully valid Txtfmt buffer; hence, you are free to make changes in
	it, using it as a scratchpad for testing the various Txtfmt mappings.

	Note: If the text in the buffer does not appear to be highlighted at
	all, it may be that you have not installed Txtfmt properly. (See
	section |txtfmt-installation|.) Currently, the :MakeTestPage command
	loads the Txtfmt plugin files by executing the following command in
	the scratch buffer: >

		:set filetype=txtfmt

<	On a typical system (one on which filetype and syntax are both
	enabled), this results in a :runtime sourcing of both
	ftplugin/txtfmt.vim and syntax/txtfmt.vim. Of course, if you have
	syntax and/or filetype plugins disabled, you will not be able to view
	the test page as it was meant to be viewed...

TRANSLATING TOKEN RANGE				*txtfmt-move-tok-range*
						*txtfmt-:MoveStartTok*
:MoveStartTok {new-starttok} [{old-vim-ver}]
	NOTE: This command changes the current buffer!

	This buffer-local command relocates the Txtfmt token range in use in
	the current buffer from its current location to {new-starttok}. Its
	purpose is to provide an easy way to change the |txtfmt-'tokrange'|
	option value in a file that already contains a large number of Txtfmt
	tokens.

	The {new-starttok} argument specifies the character code to be used as
	the start of the new token range. It should be a decimal or
	hexadecimal value, which is valid for the 'encoding' in effect.
	Note: You should NOT append the {formats} specifier to the numeric
	starttok value; the current value will be used. (See
	|txtfmt-'tokrange'| for a description of the {formats} specifier.)

	The optional {old-vim-ver} argument allows you to specify the version
	of Vim that was used to create the file being changed. This could be
	important if the following conditions are met:
		-"Long" formats are in effect.
		-The version of Vim used to create the file differs from the
		 current version.
		-Only one of these versions supports the undercurl attribute.

	Txtfmt will not attempt to move characters in the undercurl range if
	the version of Vim used to create the file does not support undercurl.
	Txtfmt will, on the other hand, move such tokens if the version used
	to create the file supports undercurl, and undercurl has not been
	explicitly disabled with the |txtfmt-'undercurl'| option. Thus, it is
	possible to translate undercurl tokens even with a version of Vim that
	doesn't support undercurl. In other words, Txtfmt uses the
	{old-vim-ver} argument to determine the "shape" of the Txtfmt token
	range that needs to be translated.
	Note: If the optional {old-vim-ver} argument is omitted, Txtfmt
	assumes the buffer was created with the current version of Vim.
	
	Since Txtfmt was first released after Vim began supporting undercurl
	(in version 7.0), the {old-vim-ver} argument can generally be omitted,
	and is included only for the sake of completeness. Note: The format of
	{old-vim-ver} is identical to the format of v:version; i.e., Vim major
	version number times 100 plus Vim minor version number. e.g.,
	    Vim 7.1 ==> "701"

	If the |txtfmt-'escape'| option is set to something other than "none",
	:MoveStartTok takes the current escape method into account, and
	attempts to do whatever makes sense with regard to escaped and
	escaping characters. Consider that escaping is used to prevent special
	interpretation of characters. When the Txtfmt token range moves, some
	of the characters that would have been interpreted specially under the
	old token range are not special at all under the new range, and hence,
	no longer require escaping. Similarly, characters that were not
	special at all under the old token range lie squarely within the new
	token range, and hence require escaping to prevent their being
	interpreted specially.

	Here's how Txtfmt handles token translation when escaping is in
	effect... Characters that are not currently special, but will be after
	the move, are escaped. Tokens that are currently escaped are not
	translated. Characters that are currently escaped to prevent special
	interpretation, but will not need to be escaped after the translation,
	have their escaping characters removed.

	Note: In the context of the preceding paragraph, a character is
	considered to be "special" if it could be interpreted as either a
	Txtfmt token or an escaping character. For details on what constitutes
	an escaping character, see |txtfmt-'escape'|.
	
	If there is a |txtfmt-modeline| containing a tokrange option setting
	in the current buffer, it will be altered to reflect the new token
	range. After the changes have been made to the buffer, the filetype
	and syntax plugins are automatically reloaded to cause the new
	tokrange setting to take effect. As a result, there should generally
	be no visible change to the buffer as a result of executing the
	:MoveStartTok command.

	Note: As previously mentioned, :MoveStartTok alters the current
	buffer. Txtfmt will save the buffer after performing the token
	translation unless there were unsaved changes when the command was
	invoked. In that case, Txtfmt assumes that the user was not yet ready
	to save the existing changes and leaves the buffer modified. Of
	course, if you don't like the changes made by the :MoveStartTok
	command, you can always undo them, regardless of whether or not the
	changes have been saved.

	Examples of use:
		Move current tokrange to start of "Private Use Area" >
		:MoveStartTok 0xE000
<
		Move current tokrange to 190 (in file created with Vim 6.3) >
		:MoveStartTok 190 603
<
